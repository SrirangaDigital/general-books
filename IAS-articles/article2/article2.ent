five
organs

understood
as
the

subtle

{M},
or
\foreignlanguage
{hindi}{अ-कार,
उ-कार,
म-कार},
together
pronounced
as
‘OM’
instead
of

It
is
because
of
the
conjunction
rule
in
Sanskrit
grammar,
which
tells
joining
\foreignlanguage
{hindi}{अ-कार}

{hindi}{उ-कार
}
yields
the

macro:->In
the
case
of
the
Big
Bang
singularity,
we
may
conceive
a
situation
with
infinite
energy
and
no
vibrational
displacement.
But
we
postulate
that
under
the
boundary
condition
of
constant
phase
space
area
alone,
the
energy
becomes
unmanifest
as
in
the
Dark
Energy,
while
the
Big
Bang
singularity
does
not
postulate
the
constant
phase
space
area.
In
fact,
the
phase
space
area
in
the
Big
Bang
singularity
is
infinity.
This
is
the
difference
between
the
CoP
and
the
Big
Bang
singularity.
The
curvature
due
to
LPE
is
zero,
while
the
curvature
due
to
Big

singularity
is
infinity.
Also,
the
phase

area
in
LPE
is
constant,
while
the
phase
space
area
in
Big

singularity
is
infinity,
the

macro:->In
a
stricter
sense,
we
cannot
even
say
it
is
‘One,’

is
the
idea

macro:->Since
the

is
pervaded
in
and
through
the
CoP,
the
will
of
the
observer
too
has
a
direct
connection
with
the
CoP.
So,
the
vibration
can
be
thought
of
as
propagated
by
the
self-willed
CoP
or
as
the
superimposition
by
the
observer.
In
any
case,
both
are
apparent.
The
actual
CoP
is
free
from
all
STV

here,
also
according

the
Vedantic
conclusion,
true
