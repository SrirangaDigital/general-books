Silent
Valley
is
a
reserve
forest
spread
across
both
sides
of
the
Kunthi
River,
which
is
a
tributary
of
the
Bharathappuzha
River
in
Palakkad
District,
Kerala.
The
Kerala
State
Electricity
Board
(hereafter,
KSEB)
found
it
appropriate
to
launch
a
hydroelectric
project
in
the
central
part
of
Silent
Valley
in
1970,
installing
four
units
of
60
MW
each.
The
KSEB
held
the
strong
contention
that
the
state’s
electricity
requirements
would
not
be
met
without
this
additional
power.
Furthermore,
the
project
aspired
to
generate
irrigation
water
for
an
additional
100
sq.
km
in
two
backward
districts
in
northern
Kerala.
KSEB
also
highlighted
the
employment
opportunities
that
the
project
was
likely
to
generate
during
its
construction
and
its
potential
to
boost
the
economy
of
the
State.
But
this
proposal
invited
huge
opposition
from
various
groups
in
Kerala,
citing
the
immense
ecological
damage
to
the
evergreen
forest
ecosystem
of
the
Silent
Valley.
Many
scientists,
ecologists,
and
social
activists
stood
against
the
project.
At
the
same
time,
many
other
scientists
and
trade
unionists
stood
with
KSEB
and
argued
for
the
project.
A
heated
debate
between
these
two
groups
could
be
considered
the
first
set
of
environmental
discussions
in
Kerala,
which,
in
turn,
helped
formulate
environmentalism
sensibility.}

By
Indian
Environmentalism,
the
paper
doesn’t
refer
to
environmentalism
in
India.
The
phrase
here
is
used
to
denote
a
different
theoretical
formation
that
talks
about
a
variety
of
environmentalism
in
India
which
is
significantly
different
from
its
Global
Northern
counterparts.
According
to
the
relevant
scholarship,
the
major
environmental
movements
in
India
show
the
characteristics
of
Indian
Environmentalism.
In
this
paper,
the
phrase
“Environmental
Movements
in
India”
is
used
on
occasions
where
the
empirical
aspect
of
the
movements
is
referred
and
“Indian
Environmentalism”
when
the
political
philosophy
of
the
movements
is
referred
to.}

It

mentioning
here
about
a
website
https://www.namboothiri.com/an
online
platform
with
several
seriously
written
notes
about
Namboothiris,
the
predominant
Brahmin
community
of
Kerala.
It
has
a
special
page
dedicated
to
“Namboothiris
in
the
Mainstream
of
Science
Popularisation”.
The
website
claims
that
many
prime
scientists
who
tried
to
popularise
science
in
Kerala,
either
by
being
part
of
the
KSSP
or
in
other
ways,
were
Namboothiris.

given

them

“Namboothiri

the

is
a
clear
indication
