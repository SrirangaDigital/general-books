\section*{Abstract}

This is an expositary article narrating  the derivation of a non-linear stochastic Schr{\"o}dinger equation describing a classical diffusion of pure quantum states of a system $S$,  driven by the Brownian motion $\mathbf{B}$, starting from the quantum stochastic differential equations of Hudson and Parthasarathy (HP) (Comm. Math. Phys. {\bf 93}, 301 (1984)). An appropriate Girsanov transformation is identified to result in the Gisin-Percival state diffusion equation (J. Phys. A {\bf 167}, 315 (1992)). This approach yields an explicit solution of the Gisin-Percival equation, in terms of the Hudson-Parthasarathy unitary process and a radomized Weyl displacement process. The well-known Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad (GKSL) master equation is unraveled after coarse-graining over the Gisin-Percival pure state trajectories. The diffusion equation for  mixed state trajectories of a quantum system  $S$ is then obtained  from the Gisin-Percival diffusion equation describing an entangled pure bipartite system with $S$ being one of its subsystems. The scalar-valued moment processes  ${\rm Tr}[\rho_t^m( \mathbf{B})], \,\,\, m=2,3,\ldots$  of the diffused mixed state  $\rho_t(\mathbf{B})$ for  $t\geq 0$,  where $\mathbf{B}$ is the underlying  complex $n$-dimensional vector-valued Brownian motion process,   are shown to admit a Doob-Meyer decomposition as the sum of a martingale $M^{(m)}_t(\mathbf{B})$ and a non-negative increasing process $S^{(m)}_t(\mathbf{B})$ for each $m=2,\, 3,\, \ldots$. This establishes the existence of the  moment processes {\em almost surely} with respect to the Wiener probability measure $\mu$  of the Brownian motion $\mathbf{B}$. In particular, the spectrum and therefore the entropy of $\rho_t (\mathbf{B})$ of a finite level quantum system converge {\em almost surely} to a limiting value asymptotically as $t\rightarrow \infty$. A technical proof indicating the {\em almost sure} convergence of the spectrum for countably infinite level systems is also given.

\section{Introduction}\label{chap5-sec1}

Irreversible dynamics of states and observables of a quantum system $S$ is usually described by a one parameter semigroup 
$\{T_t,t\geq 0\}$ of unital completely positive maps on the algebra $\mathcal{B}(\mathcal{H}_S)$ of all bounded operators on the associated system Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}_S$. Such a semigroup is called a {\it quantum dynamical semigroup}. When this semigroup is uniformly continuous, its infinitesimal generator was completely described by Gorini, Kossakowski and Sudarshan~\cite{key1} when $\mathcal{H}_S$ is finite dimensional and by Lindblad~\cite{key2} in the general case. We call it the GKSL generator, usually denoted by $\mathcal{L}$. The form of this generator $\mathcal{L}$ becomes meaningful even when the operators entering the description of $\mathcal{L}$ may be unbounded \cite{key3,key4,key5,key6} and can give rise to dynamical semigroups, which are not necessarily uniformly continuous. Since the discovery of the form of the generator $\mathcal{L}$, there have been attempts to understand the stochastic processes leading to the generator $\mathcal{L}$. This has mainly given rise to two different approaches. 

\begin{itemize}
\item Quantum stochastic calculus for operator-valued processes in $\mathcal{H}_S\otimes\mathcal{H}_R$, where $\mathcal{H}_R$ is an appropriate Boson Fock space associated with a reservoir $R$ (also called {\it bath} or {\it noise}) was investigated in the 1984 paper~\cite{key7} of Hudson and Parthasarathy (HP). Such a stochastic calculus is equipped with a {\it quantum It{\^o} formula}~\cite{key7,key8} leading to a theory of {\it quantum stochastic differential equations}. This enables, in particular, the construction of {\it unitary operator-valued processes} $\{U(t), t\geq 0\}$ satisfying a quantum stochastic differential equation in $\mathcal{H}_S\otimes\mathcal{H}_R$. It turns out that for a given GKSL generator $\mathcal{L}$, there exists a canonical unitary operator-valued process in $\mathcal{H}_S\otimes\mathcal{H}_R$ obeying a quantum stochastic differential equation of the exponential type and satisfying the identity 
$$
\langle \phi\vert T_t(X)\vert \chi \rangle=\langle \phi\otimes \Omega_0\vert U(t)^\dag\, (X\otimes I_R)\, U(t)\,\vert \chi\otimes \Omega_0 \rangle
$$ 
for all $X\in \mathcal{B}(\mathcal{H}_S)$, $\phi,\, \chi\in \mathcal{H}_S$, where  $I_R$ is the identity operator in $\mathcal{H}_R$, $\Omega_0$ denotes the  Boson Fock vacuum state,  and $\{T_t=e^{t\,\mathcal{L}}, t\geq 0\}$, the dynamical semigroup with generator $\mathcal{L}$. In other words,  $\{T_t,t\geq 0\}$ has been dilated to a Heisenberg evolution by the unitary operator-valued process $\{U(t), t\geq 0\}$. 

\item In their 1992 paper~\cite{key9} Gisin and Percival explored the possibility of constructing the dynamical semigroup $\{T_t,t\geq 0\}$ with GKSL generator $\mathcal{L}$ through classical diffusion processes, with  values on the unit sphere of the system Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}_S$, driven by a complex vector-valued standard Brownian motion $\{\mathbf{B}(t), t\geq 0\}$, with its Wiener probability measure $\mu$, on the space of paths. They arrive at a non-linear diffusion equation on the unit sphere involving the differentials $d\mathbf{B}(t)$ and $dt$, with diffusion and drift coefficients depending on the operator parameters describing $\mathcal{L}$. Such classical stochastic differential equations for processes with values in the unit sphere of $\mathcal{H}_S$ are called {\it stochastic Schr{\"o}dinger equations}.  For any initial state $\vert \phi_0\rangle$ in $\mathcal{H}_S$, the Gisin-Percival stochastic Schrodinger equation determines a {\it trajectory}   
$\{\vert\Psi_t(\mathbf{B})\rangle,\ t\geq 0\}$ of pure states in $L^2(\mu)\otimes \mathcal{H}_S$, which is driven by complex vector-valued Brownian noise $\mathbf{B}$. The system density operator $\rho_t$, obtained after coarse graining over these diffusive trajectories~\cite{key10},
$$
\rho_t=\int\, \vert \Psi_t(\mathbf{B})\rangle\langle \Psi_t(\mathbf{B})\vert\, \mu(d\mathbf{B})
$$
 obeys a GKSL master equation~\cite{key1,key2}. This determines the irreversible dynamics of states and observables in $\mathcal{H}_S$. In other words, pure state solutions of stochastic Schr{\"o}dinger equations can be  employed   effectively in studying open system dynamics.  Non-linear stochastic Schr{\"o}dinger equations have gained importance from various physical and mathematical  perspectives~\cite{key9,key10,key11,key12,key13,key14,key15,key16,key17,key18,key19,key20,key21,key22,key23,key24,key25,key26,key27,key28}. They were initially proposed~\cite{key15} as  stochastic non-linear modifications of the Schr{\"o}dinger equation, as an attempt to address the quantum measurement problem~\cite{key10,key11,key12,key13,key14,key15, key17, key22,key23,key24, key27,key28,key29,key30,key31}. 
\end{itemize}

In this article we establish a rigorous connection between the two approaches mentioned above by constructing the Gisin-Percival diffusion of pure quantum states starting from the HP~\cite{key7, key8}  quantum stochastic differential calculus. To this end, we exploit the Wiener-It{\^o}-Segal isomorphism~\cite{key32,key33,key34} between the reservoir Boson Fock space $\mathcal{H}_R$ and the Hilbert space $L^2(\mu)$, where $\mu$ denotes the Wiener probability measure on the space of paths of a vector-valued Brownian motion. We introduce Randomized Weyl displacement operators which are stochastic generalizations of the well known Weyl displacement operators~\cite{key8}.  Our approach leads to an explicit and simple realization of a solution of the Gisin-Percival diffusion equation  describing pure state quantum trajectories in terms of an HP unitary process and a randomized Weyl displacement process~\cite{key35}. 

A pure state remains pure under the Gisin-Percival quantum state diffusion at all times $t\geq 0$. Based on the Gisin-Percival diffusion equation for an entangled pure bipartite state, with $S$ being one of its subsystems, we arrive at the corresponding stochastic differential equation for mixed state trajectories of $S$. Massen and K{\"u}mmerer~\cite{key36} had  investigated  stability features of a discrete time mixed state trajectory, associated with a random chain of quantum states resulting from repeated measurements on a system. As a natural extension of this  we study the stability behaviour of the {\em spectrum} of a continuous time Gisin-Percival quantum diffusion trajectory of mixed quantum states~\cite{key37}. Using It{\^o} calculus~\cite{key38}, along with an induction procedure, we obtain the classical stochastic differential  equation for the scalar-valued moment processes  ${\rm Tr}[\rho_t^m( \mathbf{B})], \,\,\, m=2,3,\ldots$  of the diffused mixed state  $\rho_t(\mathbf{B}), \  t\geq 0$. They are shown to admit a Doob-Meyer decomposition~\cite{key39,key40} as the sum of a martingale $M^{(m)}_t(\mathbf{B})$ and a non-negative increasing process $S^{(m)}_t(\mathbf{B})$ for each $m=2,\, 3,\, \ldots$. This ensures the existence of  $\underset{t\rightarrow\infty}{\lim}\, {\rm Tr}[\rho_t^m( \mathbf{B})]$ {\em almost surely} with respect to the Wiener probability measure $\mu$ of the Brownian motion $\mathbf{B}$, for each $m=2,\, 3,\, \ldots$. In particular when  $S$ is a finite level quantum system, the spectrum and therefore the entropy of $\rho_t (\mathbf{B})$ converge {\em almost surely} to a limit asymptotically i.e., as $t\rightarrow \infty$. Using a probabilistic approach~\cite{key41,key42} we then derive a technical result implying the {\em almost sure} convergence of the spectrum for countably infinite level quantum systems. 

We begin with a description of discrete time irreversible dynamics of a finite $d$-level quantum system $S$ in Sec. \ref{chap5-sec2}. This  prepares a necessary groundwork for its natural adaptation to  continuous time noisy evolution, as formulated by HP~\cite{key7,key8}. A brief account of HP quantum stochastic calculus is presented in Sec. \ref{chap5-sec3}. A description of  {\it noisy Schr{\"o}dinger unitary evolutions} in terms of quantum stochastic differential equations is outlined here. We describe,  how a   unitary operator-valued process $\{U(t), t\geq 0\}$ obeying a quantum stochastic differerntial equation  in $\mathcal{H}_S\otimes \mathcal{H}_R$, leads to  the quantum dynamical semigroup $\{T_t, t\geq 0\}$, with GKSL generator $\mathcal{L}$.  Invariance  properties of the GKSL generator $\mathcal{L}$ under  unitary Weyl displacement process and second quantized  unitary operator-valued process is discussed  in Sec. \ref{chap5-sec4}. The basic notions of the Wiener-It{\^o}-Segal isomorphism between the reservoir space $\mathcal{H}_R$ and the Hilbert space $L^2(\mu)$ of norm square integrable functions with respect to the Wiener probability measure $\mu$ of a vector-valued Brownian motion are presented in Sec. \ref{chap5-sec5}. Starting from an HP quantum stochastic differential equation,  Gisin-Percival~\cite{Gisin} quantum state diffusion equation is derived in Sec. \ref{chap5-sec6}.  Stochastic equation describing continuous time diffusion of mixed state of a quantum system $S$, starting from the Gisin-Percival diffusion equation for an entangled pure bipartite state, with $S$ being one of its subsystems, is derived in Sec. \ref{chap5-sec7}. The diffusion equation for  the non-negative bounded scalar-valued  moment processes  $0\leq {\rm Tr}[\, \rho_t^m(\mathbf{B})]\leq 1,\ \  m=2,3,\ldots$ of the quantum trajectory $\{\rho_t(\mathbf{B}),\, t\geq 0\}$ is presented in Sec.~8. Each of the processes $\{{\rm Tr}[\rho_t^m( \mathbf{B})], t\geq 0\}$ is shown to admit a Doob-Meyer decomposition,  as the sum of a martingale $M^{(m)}_t(\mathbf{B})$ and a non-negative increasing process $S^{(m)}_t(\mathbf{B})$. In Sec. \ref{chap5-sec9} we proceed to prove the {\em almost sure} convergence of the spectrum for countably infinite level systems using a probabilistic approach.   

\section{ Irreversible discrete time dynamics of a finite quantum system}\label{chap5-sec2}

Consider a finite $d$-level system $S$ in a Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}_S$. Let $T$ be a unital completely positive map on the algebra  $\mathcal{B}(\mathcal{H}_S)$ of all bounded operators in $\mathcal{H}_S$. Then the sequence $\{T^0, T^1, T^2, T^3,\cdots\}$ determines a quantum dynamical semigroup. Thanks to the Stinespring's theorem, one can construct a finite probability space  $(\mathbb{X},\nu)$ with $\mathbb{X}=\{0,1,2,\cdots k-1\}$,  $\nu$ being the uniform distribution with mass $1/k$ at each $x\in\mathbb{X}$, and an orthonormal basis $\{\vert x\rangle, x\in \mathbb{X}\}$ in the Hilbert space $L^2(\nu)$, such that  $\vert 0\rangle$ is the constant function with value unity at every $x$ in $\mathbb{X}$ and a unitary operator $U$ in $\mathcal{H}_S\otimes L^2(\nu)$ determined by 
\begin{equation}
U\, \vert \phi  \otimes  x\rangle = \sum_{y\in \mathbb{X}}\, \left( L_{yx}\,\vert \phi\rangle\right)\otimes \vert y\rangle,\ \  
\forall\,\, \vert\phi\rangle\,\in \mathcal{H}_S,\   x\, \in\mathbb{X} \label{chap5-eq2.1}
\end{equation} 
with $L_{yx}$ being operators in $\mathcal{H}_S$ for all  $x,y\in \mathbb{X}$, so that 
\begin{equation}
T(X)=\sum_{y\in \mathbb{X}} L_{y0}^\dag\, X\, L_{y0},\ \  \forall\ X\in \mathcal{B}(\mathcal{H}_S).  \label{chap5-eq2.2}
\end{equation} 
In particular, $\sum_y\, L^\dag_{y0}\, L_{y0}=I_S$, where $I_S$ is the identity operator in $\mathcal{H}_S$. 
Denoting $\mathbb{N}=\{ 1,2,\cdots\}$ and the countable product probability space 
$$
(\Omega, \mu)=(\mathbb{X}, \nu)^{\otimes \mathbb{N}},
$$
where any sample point $\omega\in \Omega$ is a discrete trajectory 
\begin{equation}
\omega=\{x_1,x_2,\cdots, x_n,\cdots\},\ \label{chap5-eq2.3} 
\end{equation} 
with  $x_1,x_2,\cdots\in\mathbb{X}$ being independently and identically distributed with uniform distribution $\nu$. 

We consider $L^2(\mu)$ as the reservoir Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}_R$ and introduce the global system-reservoir Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}=\mathcal{H}_S\otimes \mathcal{H}_R$. The reservoir space $\mathcal{H}_R$ is equipped with the natural product orthonormal basis $\mathbb{B}$ consisting of all vectors of the form $\vert\mathbf{x}\rangle=\vert x_1\rangle\otimes \vert x_2\rangle\otimes \cdots \otimes\vert x_n\rangle\cdots\equiv \vert x_1, x_2,\cdots , x_n\cdots\rangle$, where $\mathbf{x}$ varies over all sequences of elements $x_1,x_2,\cdots$, with only a finite number of nonzero elements from $\mathbb{X}$.  We single out the state $\vert\Omega_0\rangle=\vert 0\rangle\otimes \vert 0\rangle\otimes \cdots \otimes \vert 0\rangle \cdots$ and call it 
the {\it reservoir vacuum}. Considered as a function on the probability space $(\Omega, \mu)$, the reservoir vacuum state 
$\vert\Omega_0\rangle$ is the constant function, identically equal to unity. 

Denote by $U_{0j}$, the unitary operator in $\mathcal{H}$, determined by its action, 
\begin{align} 
U_{0j}\, \vert \phi \otimes \mathbf{x}\rangle & = \sum_{y\in\mathbb{X}} \left(\, L_{y\, x_j}\, \vert\,\phi\rangle\right)\otimes \vert x_1,x_2,\cdots , x_{j-1}, y, x_{j+1},\cdots \rangle,\notag \\
& \qquad \qquad \qquad \forall\ \ \vert\phi\rangle\,\in \mathcal{H}_S, \vert\mathbf{x}\rangle\in\mathbb{B}.  \label{chap5-eq2.4}
\end{align} 
The unitary operator $U_{0j}$ acts essentially on the tensor product of $\mathcal{H}_S$ and the $j^{\rm th}$ copy of $L^2(\nu)$ in 
the reservoir space 
$$
\mathcal{H}_R=L^2(\mu)=L^2(\nu)\otimes L^2(\nu)\otimes \cdots 
$$
where the countable tensor product on the right hand side is with respect to the {\it stabilizing sequence} 
$(\vert 0\rangle, \vert 0\rangle, \cdots )$. Put 
\begin{equation} 
U_n=U_{0\,n}\, U_{0\,n-1}\, \cdots U_{0\,1},\ \ \ \  n=1,2,\cdots  \label{chap5-eq2.5}
\end{equation}     
and $U_0=I$ the identity operator in $\mathcal{H}$. Then $\{U_n\}$ determines a discrete time inhomogeneous Schr{\"o}dinger evolution satisfying 
\begin{align}
U_n\, \vert \phi \otimes \mathbf{x}\rangle & = \sum_{y_1,y_2,\cdots}\,  \left(L_{y_n\,x_n}\, L_{y_{n-1}\,x_{n-1}}\, \cdots  L_{y_1\,x_1}\, \vert \phi\rangle\right)\notag \\ 
& \qquad \qquad \otimes \vert y_1,y_2\cdots , y_n\rangle \otimes  \vert x_{n+1},x_{n+2},\cdots \rangle  \label{chap5-eq2.6}
\end{align} 
for all states $\vert \phi\rangle$ in $\mathcal{H}_S$ and $\vert \mathbf{x}\rangle\in \mathbb{B}.$
It is clear that  $U_n$ is a unitary operator in $\mathcal{H}$ for every $n$. For any operator $X\in \mathcal{B}(\mathcal{H}_S),$  
\begin{equation} 
\langle \chi\vert T^{n}(X)\vert \phi\rangle =\langle \chi\otimes \Omega_0\vert U_n^\dag\, (X\otimes I_R)\, U_n\vert \phi\otimes \Omega_0\rangle,\ \ \forall\,\, \vert \chi\rangle,\vert \phi\rangle\in \mathcal{H}_S.  \label{chap5-eq2.7}
\end{equation}    
This admits the following interpretation: The irreversible discrete time dynamics of the system $S$ described by the quantum dynamical semigroup $\{T^n\}$ is obtained by reducing the Heisenberg dynamics of the system observables, induced by the unitary Schr{\"o}dinger dynamics $\{U_n\}$ of the system plus reservoir. This reduction is in the reservoir vacuum state $\vert \Omega_0\rangle$. 

We now look at the evolution of the initial state 
\begin{equation}
\vert\psi_0\rangle=\vert \phi_0\otimes \Omega_0\rangle,\ \  \vert\phi_0\rangle\in \mathcal{H}_S  \label{chap5-eq2.8}
\end{equation}  
in $\mathcal{H}$ under $\{U_n\}$ by explicitly expressing
\begin{align} 
\vert\psi_n\rangle &= U_n\, \vert \phi_0\otimes \Omega_0\rangle \nonumber \\ 
&= \sum_{y_1,y_2,\cdots , y_n}\ \left( L_{y_n\, 0}\, L_{y_{n-1}\, 0}\, \cdots L_{y_1\, 0}\, \vert\,\phi_0\rangle\right)\notag \\
& \qquad \qquad \qquad \otimes \vert y_1, y_2,\cdots ,y_n\rangle \otimes \vert 0, 0, \cdots \rangle. \label{chap5-eq2.9}
\end{align} 
Now, let us consider a measurement on the reservoir, when the global state in $\mathcal{H}$ is  
given by $\vert\psi_n\rangle$ of \ref{chap5-eq2.9}. If we get a classical output $(y_1,y_2,\cdots, y_n)\in \mathbb{X}^n$ as a result of the measurement, the post-measured  state is  
\begin{equation} 
\vert \Psi_n(y_1,y_2,\cdots y_n)\rangle_S=\frac{\, L_{y_n\, 0}\, L_{y_{n-1}\, 0}\, \cdots L_{y_1\, 0}\, \vert\phi_0\rangle }
{\vert\vert L_{y_n\, 0}\, L_{y_{n-1}\, 0}\, \cdots L_{y_1\, 0}\, \phi_0\vert\vert}  \label{chap5-eq2.10}
\end{equation}
where $\vert\vert \phi \vert\vert$ denotes norm of the vector $\vert\phi\rangle$ in $\mathcal{H}_S$. Note that whenever the denominator vanishes, it is clear from \ref{chap5-eq2.10} that the classical output $(y_1,y_2,\cdots, y_n)$ cannot occur. Thus the random collapsed state $\vert \Psi_n(y_1,y_2,\cdots y_n)\rangle_S$ is defined only on the subset 
$$
\{(y_1,y_2,\cdots , y_n):\    L_{y_n\, 0}\, L_{y_{n-1}\, 0}\, \cdots L_{y_1\, 0}\, \vert\,\phi_0\rangle\neq 0\}\  \subset \mathbb{X}^n.
$$ 
What we have described above is succinctly illustrated  in Fig.~1 in the form of a quantum circuit. 
\begin{figure}[H]
\centering{
	\includegraphics{figures/chap5-fig1.eps}}
	\caption{Evolution of the initial state $\vert\phi_0\otimes \Omega_0\rangle$  in $\mathcal{H}=\mathcal{H}_S\otimes \mathcal{H}_R$, induced by a unitary operator $U_n$ (see \eqref{chap5-eq2.5}), followed by a measurement on the reservoir yielding a classical output $(y_1,y_2,\cdots, y_n)$ and a post measured state $\vert \Psi_n(y_1,y_2,\cdots y_n)\rangle_S$ of the system.} 
\end{figure}

Alternatively, allowing a 1-step evolution by $U_{01}$ on the initial state $\vert \phi_0\otimes 0\rangle$ and making a measurement, we  get a classical output $y_1$ and a collapsed state $\vert\Psi_1(y_1)\rangle_S$ of the system $S$ given by 
\begin{equation} 
\vert\Psi_1(y_1)\rangle_S=\frac{L_{y_1\,0}\, \vert\, \phi_0\rangle}{\vert\vert\, L_{y_1\,0}\, \phi_0\vert\vert}. \label{chap5-eq2.11}
\end{equation}
Now, allow this collapsed state to undergo a one-step evolution again, and make a measurement. We get a classical output $y_2$ and a collapsed state $\vert\Psi_2(y_1,y_2)\rangle_S$ given by  
\begin{equation}
\vert\Psi_2(y_1,y_2)\rangle_S= \frac{L_{y_2\,0}\, \vert\Psi_1(y_1)\rangle_S }{\vert\vert\, L_{y_2\,0}\,\Psi_1(y_1)\vert\vert}
=\frac{ L_{y_2\,0}\,L_{y_1\,0}\, \vert\,\phi_0\rangle}{\vert\vert L_{y_2\,0}\,L_{y_1\,0}\, \phi_0\vert\vert}.\label{chap5-eq2.12}
\end{equation} 
Repeating this procedure $n$ times, we get a classical output sequence $(y_1,y_2,\cdots , y_n)$ and the collapsed state 
$\vert\Psi_n(y_1, y_2,\cdots ,y_{n})\rangle_S$ of the system, given by the same expression as in \eqref{chap5-eq2.10}. Furthermore, 
\begin{equation}
\vert\Psi_{n+1}(y_1, y_2,\cdots ,y_{n+1})\rangle_S=\frac{ \, L_{y_{n+1}\, 0}\, \vert\, \Psi_n(y_1,y_2,\cdots y_n)\rangle_S}
{\vert\vert L_{y_{n+1}\, 0}\, \Psi_n(y_1,y_2,\cdots y_n)\vert\vert}. \label{chap5-eq2.13}
\end{equation} 
Thus the sequence $\{\vert\Psi_n(y_1, y_2,\cdots ,y_{n})\rangle_S, n=1,2,\cdots\}$ of $\mathcal{H}_S$-valued random variables is a Markovian sequence~\cite{key9, key29,key30,key31, key36}, adapted to the random trajectory $(y_1,y_2,\cdots)$ of the reservoir, occurring as a classical stochastic process in the wake of successive measurements.

Put 
$$
\nu_n(y_1,y_2,\ldots, y_n)=\vert\vert L_{y_{n}\, 0} \cdots L_{y_2\,0}\,L_{y_1\,0}\, \phi_0\vert\vert^2
$$
and observe that 
$$
\sum_{(y_1,y_2,\cdots , y_n)\in \mathbb{X}^n}\, \nu_n(y_1,y_2,\ldots, y_n)=1.
$$
Moreover, 
$$
\sum_{y_{n+1}\in \mathbb{X}}\, \nu_{n+1}(y_1,y_2,\ldots, y_n,y_{n+1})=\nu_n(y_1,y_2,\ldots, y_n),
$$
for $n=1,2,\cdots$. In other words, $\nu_n$ is a probability distribution on $\mathbb{X}^n$, which is also the marginal distribution of $\nu_{n+1}$ on the product of the first $n$ copies of $\mathbb{X}$.  Thus, $\{\nu_n\}$ is a consistent family of distributions over $\{\mathbb{X}^n\}$. By Kolmogorov's consistency theorem, there exists a unique probability measure $\nu_\infty$ in the countable product space 
$\Omega=\mathbb{X}^\infty$, whose  marginal on the product of the first $n$ copies of $\mathbb{X}$ is $\nu_n$ for every $n=1,2,\cdots$. The probability measure $\nu_\infty$ describes the statistics of the discrete measurement sequence $(y_1,y_2,\cdots )$.  Putting  
$$
Z_n(\mathbf{y})=k^n\, \nu_n(y_1,y_2,\cdots , y_n),\ n=1,2,\cdots, \mathbf{y}=\omega\in\Omega, 
$$
we obtain the likelihood ratio  martingale sequence $\{Z_n\}$ in the probability space $(\Omega, \mu)$. The sequence $\{Z_n\}$ is a non-negative martingale, with $\mathbb{E}_\mu\, [Z_n]=1$, for all $n$. However, there is no guarantee that $\nu_\infty$ is absolutely continuous with respect to $\mu$. Thus, the martingale $\{Z_n\}$ need not converge to a finite random variable.  A simple computation shows that 
\begin{align*}
	\sum_{(y_1,y_2,\cdots , y_n)\in \mathbb{X}^n}\, & \left\vert \Psi_n(y_1,y_2,\cdots , y_n)\right\rangle \left\langle 
	\Psi_n(y_1,y_2,\cdots , y_n)   \right\vert\ \nu_n(y_1,y_2,\cdots, y_n)  \\    
	=& \int_\Omega\, \left\vert \Psi_n(y_1,y_2,\cdots , y_n)\right\rangle \left\langle\Psi_n(y_1,y_2,\cdots , y_n)   
	\right\vert \, \nu_\infty(d\mathbf{y}) \\ 
	=& \int_\Omega\, \left\vert \Psi_n(y_1,y_2,\cdots , y_n)\right\rangle \left\langle\Psi_n(y_1,y_2,\cdots , y_n)\right\vert \, Z_n(\mathbf{y})\, \mu(d\mathbf{y}), 
\end{align*}
where  $\nu_\infty(d\mathbf{y})$ gets replaced by $Z_n(\mathbf{y})\, \mu(d \mathbf{y})$ for all $n=1,2,\cdots.$ 

This summarizes the way the discrete time irreversible dynamics  is determined by the discrete time state-valued Markov chain $\{\vert\Psi_n(\cdot)\rangle\}$ starting from $\vert\phi_0 \otimes \Omega_0\rangle$.  Furthermore, this suggests a natural route for an extension to the continuous time irreversible dynamics described by a quantum dynamical semigroup $\{T_t, t\geq 0\}$ with GKSL generator $\mathcal{L}$. We can replace the discrete Schr{\"o}dinger evolution $\{U_n, n=0,1,2,\cdots\}$ by the HP unitary dilation $\{U(t), t\geq 0\}$ of $\{T_t, t\geq 0\}$ in the tensor product of $\mathcal{H}_S$ with an appropriate Boson Fock space $\mathcal{H}_R$, and transfer it to $\mathcal{H}_S\otimes L^2(\mu)$ with $\mu$ as the Wiener probability measure of a suitable multidimensional Brownian motion $\{\mathbf{B}(t),\, t\geq 0\}$, using the Wiener-It{\^o}-Segal isomorphism. Putting $\vert\psi_t\rangle=U(t)\, \vert \phi_0\otimes \Omega_0\rangle$, with $\vert\phi_0\rangle\in \mathcal{H}_S$, $\vert\Omega_0\rangle$ being the constant function in $L^2(\mu)$, identically equal to unity, and  normalizing $\vert\psi_t\rangle$ in $\mathcal{H}_S$, we shall arrive at a state diffusion process $\{\vert \Psi_t(\mathbf{B})\rangle, t\geq 0\},$ which is a perfect continuous time analogue of the Markov chain $\{\vert \Psi_n(\cdot )\rangle\}$ given by \eqref{chap5-eq2.11}-\eqref{chap5-eq2.13}.

\section{Boson Fock space and quantum stochastic evolutions}\label{chap5-sec3}

We begin with some general observations on the Boson Fock space $\Gamma(\mathfrak{h})$ over a Hilbert space $\mathfrak{h}$ defined by 
\begin{equation}
\Gamma(\mathfrak{h})=\mathbb{C}\oplus \mathfrak{h} \oplus \mathfrak{h}^{\textcircled{s}^2} \oplus \cdots \oplus \mathfrak{h}^{\textcircled{s}^r}\oplus \cdots  \label{chap3-eq3.1}
\end{equation} 
where $\mathbb{C}$ denotes the one dimensional complex Hilbert space and  $\textcircled{s}^r$ indicates $r$-fold symmetric tensor product of copies of $\mathfrak{h}$. To each $u\in \mathfrak{h}$, its associated exponential vector $e(u)$ is defined by 
\begin{equation} 
e (u) = 1 \oplus u \oplus \frac{u^{\otimes^{2}}}{\sqrt{2!}}  \oplus \cdots \oplus \frac{u^{\otimes^{r}}}{\sqrt{r!}}  \oplus \cdots.\label{chap5-eq3.2}
\end{equation}
The linear manifold generated by all such exponential vectors is denoted by $\mathcal{E}$. Any finite set of exponential vectors is linearly independent and $\mathcal{E}$ is dense in $\Gamma(\mathfrak{h})$. This implies that any map from the set of all exponential vectors into 
$\Gamma(\mathfrak{h})$ extends to an operator in $\Gamma(\mathfrak{h})$ with domain $\mathcal{E}$. 
Any isometry on the set of exponential vectors extends to an isometry on $\Gamma(\mathfrak{h})$. The map $u\rightarrow e(u)$ is strongly continuous and for all $u,\,\, v\in \mathfrak{h}$ 
\begin{equation}
\langle e(u)\vert e(v)\rangle = {\rm exp}\langle u\vert v\rangle . \label{chap5-eq3.3}
\end{equation}
Any element of the subspace $\mathfrak{h}^{\textcircled{s}^r}$ in $\Gamma(\mathfrak{h})$ is called an $r$-particle vector. 
The linear manifold $\mathcal{M}$ generated by $\bigcup \mathfrak{h}^{\textcircled{s}^r}$ in  $\Gamma(\mathfrak{h})$ is called the manifold of finite particle vectors. To any $u\in \mathfrak{h}$, there is associated a pair of operators $a(u)$, $a^\dag(u)$, defined on the linear manifold $\mathcal{M}$, which are closable (with their corresponding closures denoted by the same symbols) and  are called the creation-annihilation pairs associated with $u$. Then, $\mathcal{E}$ is contained in the domain of $a(u)$ and $a^\dag(u)$. These operators  are adjoint to each other on $\mathcal{M}$ and $\mathcal{E}$. They enjoy very important properties and the algebra generated by them gives rise to a rich family of observables. 

The map $u\rightarrow a(u)$ is antilinear whereas  $u\rightarrow a^\dag({u})$ is linear.  The operator $a(u)+a^\dag(u)$ closes to a selfadjoint operator and therefore, yields an observable. The linear manifolds $\mathcal{M}$ and $\mathcal{E}$ are in the domain of products of all operators of the form $F_1, F_2, \cdots , F_l$ where each $F_i$ is either $a(u_i)$ or $a^\dag(u_i)$ for each $i=1,2,\cdots l$. On both 
$\mathcal{M}$ and $\mathcal{E}$ the creation and annihilation operators obey the canonical commutation relations: 
\begin{eqnarray}
 [a(u),\, a(v)]= 0,  [a^\dag(u),\, a^\dag(v)] = 0, [a(u),\, a^\dag(v)] = \langle u\vert v\rangle. \label{chap5-eq3.4}
\end{eqnarray} 
Furthermore, 
\begin{equation}
a(u)\, e(v)=\langle u\vert v\rangle\, e(v), \ \forall\ \ u, v\in \mathfrak{h}. \label{chap5-eq3.5}
\end{equation}
If $\mathfrak{h}_1,\ \mathfrak{h}_2$ are two Hilbert spaces,  the correspondence 
\begin{equation}
e(u_1\oplus u_2)\rightarrow e(u_1)\otimes e(u_2), \ \ \forall\ \, u_i\in\mathfrak{h}_i, i=1,2\label{chap5-eq3.6}
\end{equation} 
extends to a Hilbert space isomorphism between $\Gamma(\mathfrak{h}_1\oplus\mathfrak{h}_2)$ and $\Gamma(\mathfrak{h}_1)\otimes\Gamma(\mathfrak{h}_2)$. 

Now we specialize to the case where $\mathfrak{h}=L^2(\mathbb{R}_+,\mathbb{C}^n)=L^2(\mathbb{R}_+)\otimes \mathbb{C}^n$, where $L^2(\mathbb{R}_+)$ is the  Hilbert space of absolutely square integrable functions on the half-interval $\mathbb{R}_+=[0,\infty)$, with respect to the Lebesgue measure  and  $\mathbb{C}^n$  denotes the standard $n$-dimensional complex Hilbert space.  The Hilbert space $L^2(\mathbb{R}_+)\otimes \mathbb{C}^n$ can be viewed as the space of $\mathbb{C}^n$-valued norm square integrable functions on $\mathbb{R}_{+}$. 
Any element $\mathbf{u}\in L^2(\mathbb{R}_+) \otimes \mathbb{C}^n$ may be expressed as,  
$$
\mathbf{u}= u_1\oplus u_2\oplus \cdots \oplus u_n,\ \ \ \ \ \ u_k\in L_2(\mathbb{R}_+),\  k=1,2,\cdots, n.
$$
With any $\mathbf{u}\in L^2(\mathbb{R}_+)\otimes \mathbb{C}^n$, we associate the exponential vector $e(\mathbf{u})$ in 
$\Gamma(L^2(\mathbb{R}_+)\otimes \mathbb{C}^n)$. For any $\mathbf{u}$ and $\mathbf{v}$ in $L^2(\mathbb{R}_+)\otimes \mathbb{C}^n$ we have 
\begin{eqnarray}
\langle e(\mathbf{u})\vert e(\mathbf{v})\rangle={\exp}\langle \mathbf{u}\vert \mathbf{v}\rangle 
={\exp}\left[\sum_{k=1}^n\,\int_0^\infty\,  u_k^*\, v_k\, dt\right]. \label{chap5-eq3.7}
\end{eqnarray}
The vacuum vector $e(\mathbf{\mathbf{0}}) =   1 \oplus \mathbf{0} \oplus \mathbf{0} \oplus \cdots$ in  $\Gamma(L^2(\mathbb{R}_+)\otimes \mathbb{C}^n)$ is denoted by 
$\Omega_0$.  

We consider a quantum system $S$  in a Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}_S$, coupled to a reservoir $R$ in a Boson Fock space $\mathcal{H}_R = \Gamma (L^2 (\mathbb{R}_+) \otimes \mathbb{C}^n)$.  The global Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}=\mathcal{H}_S\otimes\mathcal{H}_R$ is used to describe events, observables and states of the system plus reservoir. The noise processes can be described by observables in the general continuous tensor product Hilbert space of the reservoir for which  the Boson Fock space $\Gamma (L^2 (\mathbb{R}_+)\otimes \mathbb{C}^n)$ serves as one of the simplest models. The space $\mathbb{C}^n$ corresponds to $n$ degrees of freedom in the selection of noise. 

For any $0<t_1<t_2\cdots <t_r<\infty$, we have the following decomposition of $\mathcal{H}=\mathcal{H}_S\otimes \mathcal{H}_R$: 
\begin{eqnarray*}
	\mathcal{H}([0,t))&=&\mathcal{H}_S\otimes \Gamma(L^2([0,t))\otimes \mathbb{C}^n),   \\
	\mathcal{H}([t_{r-1},t_{r})) &=& \Gamma(L^2([t_{r-1},t_{r}))\otimes \mathbb{C}^n), \\
	\mathcal{H}([t_r,\infty)) &=& \Gamma(L^2([t_r,\infty))\otimes \mathbb{C}^n), 														
\end{eqnarray*} 
and we denote the restrictions of $\mathbf{u}$ to the time intervals $[0,t]$, $[t_1,t_2)$, $[t_{r-1},t_{r})$, and $[t_r,\infty)$ by 
\begin{eqnarray*}
	\left.\mathbf{u}\right\vert_{[0,t)}=\mathbf{u}_{t]},  \ \  \left.\mathbf{u}\right\vert_{[t_1,t_2)}=\mathbf{u}_{[t_{1},t_{2})},  \ \ 
	\left.\mathbf{u}\right\vert_{[t_{r-1},t_{r})}=\mathbf{u}_{[t_{r-1},t_{r})},  \ \ 
	\left.\mathbf{u}\right\vert_{[t_r,\infty)}=\mathbf{u}_{[t_r}.
\end{eqnarray*} 

From the correspondence given by (\ref{esumproduct}), it follows that, there exists a unique unitary isomorphism $\mathcal{U}: \mathcal{H} \rightarrow \mathcal{H}([0,t_{1})) \otimes 
\mathcal{H}([t_{1}, t_{2})) \otimes \cdots \otimes \mathcal{H}([t_{r-1},t_{r})) \otimes \mathcal{H}([t_{r},\infty))$ satisfying,     
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{U}\, \phi\otimes e(\mathbf{u}) = \phi\otimes e(\mathbf{u}_{t_1]})) \otimes e(\mathbf{u}_{[t_1,t_2)})\otimes \cdots 
\otimes e(\mathbf{u}_{[t_{r-1},t_r)}) \otimes e(\mathbf{u}_{[t_r})   \label{chap5-eq3.8}
\end{equation}
for all $\phi\in \mathcal{H}_S$ and  $e(\mathbf{u})\in \mathcal{H}_R$. 

Using the notions of creation and annihilation operators introduced in \eqref{chap5-eq3.4}, \eqref{chap5-eq3.5}, we consider the family of linear operators  
$\{A_k(t), t\geq 0\}$ and  $\{A^\dag_k(t), t\geq 0\}$ as follows: 
\begin{eqnarray}
A_k(t)&=&I_S \otimes a \left (1_{[0,t]}  \otimes \vert k\rangle \right ) \label{chap5-eq3.9} \\
A^\dagger_k(t) &=& I_S \otimes a^{\dagger} \left (1_{[0,t]}  \otimes \vert k\rangle \right )  \label{chap5-eq3.10} 
\end{eqnarray}
where $\{\vert k\rangle = (0, \cdots, 0, 1,0,\cdots,0)\}$ (with $1$ in the $k$-th place), $k=1,2, \cdots, n$, is  a canonical orthonormal basis in $\mathbb{C}^n $;   $1_{[0,t]}$ denotes the indicator function of the interval $[0,t]$ for each $t\in\mathbb{R}_+$ and $I_S$  denotes the identity operator in $\mathcal{H}_S$. The operators defined in \eqref{chap5-eq3.9} and \eqref{chap5-eq3.10} obey the canonical commutation relations (CCRs): 
\begin{eqnarray}
\, [A_k(s),A_l(t)]&=&0=[A^\dag_k(s),A^\dag_l(t)], \label{chap5-eq3.11} \\   
\, [A_k (s),A^\dag_l(t)]&=&\delta_{kl}\, (s \wedge t)\, I_S\otimes I_R. \label{chap5-eq3.12}
\end{eqnarray}
Here $s\wedge t$ denotes the minimum of $s$ and $t$. 

The operators $A_k(t),\ A^\dag_k(t)$ are well-defined on the linear manifold generated by elements of the form $\phi 
\otimes e (\mathbf{u}),$ with $\phi \in \mathcal{H}_S$ and $\mathbf{u} \in L^2(\mathbb{R}_+\otimes \mathbb{C}^n)$. In particular, one obtains the following eigen-relation for $A_k(t)$: 
\begin{eqnarray} 
A_k(t)\,  \vert \phi \otimes e(\mathbf{u})\rangle &=& \left(\int_{0}^{t} u_k(s)\, ds\, \right)\, \,\vert\phi \otimes e(\mathbf{u})\rangle \eqref{chap5-eq3.13}
\end{eqnarray} 
and consequently, the adjoint relation for $A^\dag_k(t)$ follows: 
\begin{eqnarray} 
\langle \phi \otimes e(\mathbf{u})  \vert A^\dag_k(t) &=& \langle \phi \otimes e(\mathbf{u})  \vert \left(\int_{0}^{t} u^*_k(s)\, ds\, \right). \label{chap5-eq3.13}
\end{eqnarray}
The family of operators $\{A_k(t), t\geq 0\}$, $\{A^\dag_k(t), t\geq 0\}$ are respectively called the annihilation and creation processes. These are the fundamental noise processes of quantum stochastic calculus. (For more detailed description of fundamental noise processes in Boson Fock space, including conservation noise process, see Refs.~\cite{key7, key8}).  

A family $X = \left \{ X(t), 0 \leq t < \infty \right \}$ of operators in  $\mathcal{H}$ is said to be {\it adapted} if, for each $t,$ there exists an operator $X_t$ in $\mathcal{H}([0,t))$ such that 
$$
X(t) = X_t \otimes I_{[t}
$$ 
where $I_{[t}$ is the identity operator in $\mathcal{H}([t,\infty)).$  Further, an adapted process $X$ is said to be {\it simple} with respect to a partition $0 < t_1 < t_2 < \cdots < t_r < \cdots $ of $[0, \infty)$ such that $t_r \rightarrow \infty$ as $r \rightarrow \infty$, if 
\begin{equation}
X(t)=X({t_j})=X_{t_j} \otimes I_{[t_j} \ \  {\rm when}\ t_j\leq t<t_{j+1},\ \ j=0,1,2,\cdots .  \label{chap5-eq15}
\end{equation}
Let $\{L(t)\}$ be such a {\it simple adapted process} and $\{M(t)\}$ be any one of the fundamental operator-valued adapted processes $\{A_k(t)\}$, $\{A_k^\dag(t)\},\ k=1,2,\cdots , n$. Then,  the stochastic integral of   $\{L(t)\}$, with respect to  $\{M(t)\}$  is defined by  
\begin{eqnarray}
X(t)&=&\int_{0}^t\,  L(s)\, d\, M(s)  \nonumber \\
&=&\sum_{t_j}\, L_{t_j}\, \left( M (t_{j+1} \wedge t)- M (t_{j} \wedge t)\right),  \nonumber\\ 
&&\qquad \qquad \qquad  t_j\leq t<t_{j+1},  j=0,1,2,\cdots . \label{chap5-eq3.16} 
\end{eqnarray}
It is clear that the operators $L_{t_j}$ and  $M (t_{j+1} \wedge t)- M (t_{j} \wedge t)$ commute with each other i.e., $ L(s)\, d\, M(s)$ can be written as $d\, M(s)\, L(s).$ 

As shown in Ref.~\cite{key7}, the notion of such integrals can be extended by a completion procedure to a wide class of adapted processes, which are not necessarily simple. Such an integration is a linear operation in the space of adapted processes.  For details see Sec. \ref{chap5-sec4} of Ref.~\cite{key7}. 

We consider adapted processes of the form  
\begin{eqnarray}
X(t)=X(0)+ \int_0^t\, \sum_{k=1}^n\, \left(E_{k}(s)\, dA^\dag_k(s)\, + F_{k}(s)\, dA_k(s)+ G_{k}(s)\, ds\right)  \label{chap5-eq3.17}
\end{eqnarray}    
where $X(0)=X_0\otimes I_R$,  $X_0$ is an operator in the system Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}_S$ and $I_R$ denotes the identity operator in $\mathcal{H}_R$; the integrands $E_k(t), F_k(t), G_k(t)$ are adapted processes. 
We write \eqref{chap5-eq3.17}  in the differential form as, 
\begin{eqnarray}
dX(t)=\sum_{k=1}^n\, \left( E_{k}(t) dA^\dag_k(t)\, + F_{k}(t)\, dA_k(t)+\,  G_{k}(t)\, dt\right),  \label{chap5-eq3.18}
\end{eqnarray}    
with initial value $X(0)=X_0\otimes I_R$. 

The central result of quantum stochastic calculus is the following quantum It{\^o}  multiplication table~\cite{key7, key8}, summarized as follows: 
\begin{equation}    
\begin{tabular}{c||c|c|c}
&\hskip 0.1in $dA^\dag_k \hskip 0.1in$   &\hskip 0.1in $dA_k$ \hskip 0.1in & \hskip 0.1in $dt$ \hskip 0.1in \\ 
\hline 
\hline
\hskip 0.1in $dA^\dag_l$ \hskip 0.1in & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 
\hline 
$dA_l$ & $\delta_{kl}\ dt$ & 0 & 0 \\ 
\hline 
$dt$ & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 
\hline
\end{tabular}\label{chap5-eq3.19}
\end{equation}

The product of two stochastic integrals is again a stochastic integral, the  differentials of which satisfy the modified Leibnitz relation, 
\begin{equation}
d(X\,Y)= (dX)\, Y+ X\, (dY)+\, (dX)\, (dY).  \label{chap5-eq3.20}  
\end{equation} 
Quantum It\^{o} multiplication table \eqref{chap5-eq3.19}  is employed in \eqref{chap5-eq3.20} to express the differential $d(X\,Y)$ of the product of  adapted processes $X$, $Y$ in terms of the fundamental operator-valued differentials $dA^\dag_k,\, dA_k$ and $dt$.  This provides a simple and natural extension of It\^{o}  calculus based on Brownian motion~\cite{key38} to  its quantum counterpart in the Boson Fock space. 

One of the most successful applications of  HP quantum stochastic calculus is the realization of unitary dilations of quantum dynamical semigroups through Schr{\"o}dinger evolutions of open systems. Such a Schr{\"o}dinger evolution can be expressed through a {\it unitary operator-valued process} obeying a quantum stochastic differential equation of the form,
\begin{equation}
dU(t) =\left(\sum_{k=1}^n\, \left(L^{(1)}_k\, dA^\dag_k(t) +
L^{(2)}_k\, dA_k(t) \right) + L^{(3)}\, dt \right)\! U(t),\ \ \ U(0)=I \label{chap5-eq3.21}  
\end{equation} 
in  $\mathcal{H}=\mathcal{H}_S\otimes \mathcal{H}_R$, where  $L^{(1)}_k, L^{(2)}_k$ and  $L^{(3)}$  are bounded operators in $\mathcal{H}_S$. It is shown~\cite{key7} that a unique unitary solution for \eqref{chap5-eq3.21} exists if  
\begin{eqnarray}
L^{(1)}_k&=&L_k, L^{(2)}_k=-L^\dag_k\nonumber \\
L^{(3)}&=&-i\, H - \frac{1}{2}\, \sum_{k=1}^n\, L_k^\dag\, L_k \label{chap5-eq3.22}  
\end{eqnarray}
and $H$ is a self-adjoint operator.  Taking the conditions \eqref{chap5-eq3.22} into account, \eqref{chap5-eq3.21} can be expressed as~\cite{key7, key8}  
\begin{align}
dU(t) &=\left[\sum_{k=1}^n\, \left(L_k\, dA^\dag_k(t) -L^\dag_k\, dA_k(t)\right) -\left(i\, H+ \frac{1}{2}\, \sum_{k=1}^n\, L_k^\dag\, L_k \right) \, dt \right] U(t),\notag \\ 
& \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad U(0)=I, \label{chap5-eq3.23}
\end{align}
which is referred to as the HP equation. In terms of the set of operators $\mathbf{L}=(L_1,L_2,\cdots, L_n)$ and $H$, we denote the unitary process $\{U(t), t\geq 0\}$ satisfying \eqref{chap5-eq3.23} by  $U\! (\mathbf{L}, H)$. In the special case of $L_k=0$ for all $k=1,2,\cdots, n$, one obtains the familiar Schr{\"o}dinger unitary dynamics 
\begin{equation}
dU(t)=-i\, H\, U(t), \label{chap5-eq3.24}  
\end{equation}
with $H$ being the Hamiltonian of the quantum system.    It is of interest to note that there do exist examples with unique unitary solutions, when the coefficients $L_k$ and $H$ in \eqref{chap5-eq3.23} are unbounded~\cite{key3,key4,key5,key6}. 

We may now use the unitary process $\{U(t), t\geq 0\}$ to describe  noisy Heisenberg dynamics. To this end, consider any bounded operator $X$ in the system Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}_S$ (i.e., $X\in \mathcal{B}(\mathcal{H}_S)$),  and a unitary process $U\!(\mathbf{L}, H)$. Define a homomorphism $j_t:  \ \mathcal{B}(\mathcal{H}_S)\longrightarrow 
\mathcal{B}(\mathcal{H}_S\otimes\mathcal{H}_R)$ by 
\begin{equation}
j_t (X) = U(t)^{\dagger} (X \otimes I_R)  U(t), \quad t \ge 0. \label{chap5-eq3.25}
\end{equation}
Using the relation \eqref{chap5-eq3.20} and employing the quantum It\^{o} multiplication table given by \eqref{chap5-eq3.19},  one obtains 
\begin{equation}
dj_t(X)= \sum_{k=1}^{n}\, \left\{\, j_t\left([X, L_k]\right)\, dA^\dag_k(t)  - j_t\left([X,L_k^\dag]\right)\, dA_k(t) \right\} +j_t\left(\mathcal{L}(X)\right)\, dt,   \label{chap5-eq3.26}
\end{equation}
where   the map $\mathcal{L}$  from $\mathcal{B}(\mathcal{H}_S)$ to itself is given by 
\begin{eqnarray}
\mathcal{L}(X)&=& i\left[ H,\,  X\right]- \frac{1}{2} \sum_{k=1}^{n}\left(L^\dag_k\, L_k\, X + X\, L^\dag_k\, L_k -2\, L^\dag_k\, X\, L_k\right)  \label{chap5-eq3.27}
\end{eqnarray} 
Equation \eqref{chap5-eq3.26} describes noisy evolution of system observables $X$. If  $L_{k}=0 \ \ \ \forall\ \,k,$ then \eqref{chap5-eq3.26} reduces to the well-known Heisenberg equation of motion for the observable $X$:
$$
\frac{d j_t (X)}{dt} = j_t (i [H,X]).
$$

For any operator $F$ in $\mathcal{H}$ we define the {\it vacuum conditional expectation value} as the unique operator $\mathbb{E}_{\Omega_0} (F)$ in $\mathcal{H}_S$ determined by,
\begin{equation} 
\langle \phi\vert \mathbb{E}_{\Omega_0} (F) \vert \chi\rangle= \langle \phi\otimes \Omega_0 |F| \chi \otimes \Omega_0\rangle,\ \ \forall\,\, \ \phi,\chi \in \mathcal{H}_S. \label{chap5-eq3.28}
\end{equation}
Now, we write the vacuum conditional expectation value of $j_t (X)$ as   
\begin{eqnarray}
\mathbb{E}_{\Omega_0} \left(j_t(X)\right)&=&\mathbb{E}_{\Omega_0}\, \left(U(t)^{\dagger} (X \otimes I_R)  U(t)\right)\nonumber \\ 
&=&T_t(X) \label{chap5-eq3.29}
\end{eqnarray} 
Thus one obtains 
\begin{equation}
\frac{d T_t (X)}{dt} = T_t (\mathcal{L}(X))=\mathcal{L}\left(T_t(X)\right) \label{chap5-eq3.30}
\end{equation} 
for the time evolution of the quantum dynamical semigroup of completely positive unital maps 
\begin{equation}
T_t={\rm exp}( t\, \mathcal{L}),\ \  t\geq 0 \label{chap5-eq3.31}
\end{equation}  
on $\mathcal{B}(\mathcal{H}_S)$ generated by  $\mathcal{L}$ of \eqref{chap5-eq3.27}).  This coincides with the well-known form obtained by Gorini, Kossakowski, Sudarshan~\cite{key1} and Lindblad~\cite{key2}.  

For the intial state $\rho_0\otimes \vert \Omega_0\rangle\langle\Omega_0\vert$ of the system plus reservoir, we express,
\begin{eqnarray}
{\rm Tr}\left(\rho_0\otimes \vert \Omega_0\rangle\langle\Omega_0\vert\, j_t(X)\right)&=& {\rm Tr}\left(\rho_0\, T_t(X)\right) \nonumber \\ 
&=& {\rm Tr}\left(\rho_t\, X\right), \label{chap5-eq3.32}
\end{eqnarray} 
where $\rho_t={\rm Tr}_R\left( U(t)\, \rho_0\otimes \vert \Omega_0\rangle\langle\Omega_0\vert\, U(t)^\dag\right)$ denotes the reduced density operator of the quantum system. Using \eqref{chap5-eq3.29}-\eqref{chap5-eq3.32}) we get the Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad (GKSL) master equation for $\rho_t$ :
\begin{equation}
\frac{d \rho_t}{dt} = -i [ H,\,\rho_t]- \frac{1}{2} \sum_{k=1}^{n}\left(L^\dag_k\, L_k\, \rho_t + \rho_t\, L^\dag_k\, L_k -2\, L_k\, \rho_t\, L^\dag_k\right).  \label{chap5-eq3.33}
\end{equation}  
In the next section we discuss the invariance properties of the GKSL generator $\mathcal{L}$.   

\section{Symmetries of the GKSL generator} \label{chap5-sec4}

Let $\{R_i(t)=I_S\otimes F_i(t), t\geq 0\}$, i=1,2  be unitary adapted processes in $\mathcal{H}$ such that  $\{F_i(t), t\geq 0\},\, i=1,2$, act only on the reservoir space $\mathcal{H}_R$. Let 
\begin{eqnarray}
F_2(t)\vert\, \Omega_0\rangle=F_2(t)^\dag\,\vert \Omega_0\rangle=\vert\Omega_0\rangle\, ,\ \ t\geq 0. \label{chap5-eq4.1}
\end{eqnarray}
Consider the process 
\begin{equation}
\{V(t)=R_1(t)\, U(t)\, R_2(t),\  t\geq 0\} \label{chap5-eq4.2}
\end{equation} 
where  $U(t)$ satisfies the HP equation \eqref{chap5-eq3.23}. Define a homomorphism $j'_t:  \ \mathcal{B}(\mathcal{H}_S)\longrightarrow \mathcal{B}(\mathcal{H}_S\otimes\mathcal{H}_R)$ by 
\begin{eqnarray}
j'_t (X) = V^{\dagger}(t) (X \otimes I_R)  V(t), \quad t \ge 0.   \label{chap5-eq4.3}
\end{eqnarray}
Then, the vacuum conditional expectation value (see \eqref{chap5-eq3.28} and \eqref{chap5-eq3.29}) of $j'_{t}(X)$ is given by, 
\begin{eqnarray}
\mathbb{E}_{\Omega_0} \left(j'_t(X)\right) &=& \mathbb{E}_{\Omega_0}\, \left(R^{\dagger}_2(t)\, U^\dag(t)\, R^\dag_1(t) (X \otimes I_R)  R_1(t)\, U(t)\, R_2(t)\right)\nonumber \\
&=& \mathbb{E}_{\Omega_0}\,\left( U^\dag(t)\,  (X \otimes I_R)  U(t)\, \right)\nonumber\\
&=&\mathbb{E}_{\Omega_0} \left(j_t(X)\right)=T_t(X) =e^{t\,\mathcal{L}}(X).   \label{chap5-eq4.4}
\end{eqnarray} 
for all $t\geq 0$ and $X$ in $\mathcal{B}(\mathcal{H}_S)$. Thus, conjugation by the unitary adapted processes $\{U(t)\}$ and $\{V(t)\}$ yield the reduced dynamics of the quantum system with  the same GKSL generator $\mathcal{L}$. 
In the following, we discuss two important examples of $\{V(t), t\geq 0\}$, which specialize to {\em the  translation  and the rotation invariance} of the GKSL generator $\mathcal{L}$. 

\medskip
\noindent \textbf{\large{Example 1:  The translation invariance property of $\mathcal{L}$}} 
\medskip

In analogy with exponential vectors of \eqref{chap5-eq3.2} we now introduce {\it exponential operators}  in $\mathcal{H}_R$ as follows:  For any $\mathbf{f}\in L^2(\mathbb{R}_+)\otimes \mathbb{C}^n$, we write, on the set of exponential vectors, 
\begin{equation}
W(\mathbf{f}) e(\mathbf{u}) = e^{-\frac{1}{2} ||\mathbf{f}||^{2} - \langle \mathbf{f}|\mathbf{u} \rangle} e (\mathbf{f}+\mathbf{u}) \quad \forall\, \ \mathbf{u}\in\mathcal{K},      \label{chap5-eq4.5}
\end{equation} 
where $\vert\vert\mathbf{f}\vert\vert^{2}=\int_0^{\infty} \vert \mathbf{f}\vert^2\, dt,$ and $\vert \mathbf{f}\vert^2= \sum_{k=1}^{n}\,\vert  f_k\vert^2$.  The exponential operator $W(\mathbf{f})$ preserves the scalar product between exponential vectors and therefore extends to a unique unitary operator in $\mathcal{H}_R$, which we denote by the same symbol $W(\mathbf{f})$. 

A normalized vector $\alpha(\mathbf{f})\in\mathcal{H}_R$  given by    
\begin{eqnarray} 
\alpha(\mathbf{f})&=&W(\mathbf{f})\, e(\mathbf{0}) =  e^{-\frac{1}{2} ||\mathbf{f}||^{2}}\, e (\mathbf{f}), \ \ 
\mathbf{f}\in L^2(\mathbb{R_+})\otimes \mathbb{C}^n,    \label{chap5-eq4.6}
\end{eqnarray} 
is called a {\it coherent state} associated with $\mathbf{f}$.  

The operators $W(\mathbf{f}),\ W(\mathbf{g})$ obey the multiplication relation, 
\begin{equation}
W(\mathbf{f}) W(\mathbf{g}) = e^{-i \,\,{\rm Im} \langle \mathbf{f}|\mathbf{g} \rangle}\, W(\mathbf{f}+\mathbf{g}),\ \ \forall\, \ \mathbf{f},\mathbf{g}\in \mathcal{K}. \label{chap5-eq4.7}
\end{equation}
These are the well known Weyl canonical commutation relations (CCRs) of which the CCRs of creation and annihilation operators \eqref{chap5-eq3.4} are the infinitesimal versions. We call  $W(\mathbf{f})$ the Weyl displacement operator associated with $\mathbf{f}.$ 

Now, for any map $\mathbf{f}:\mathbb{R}_+\rightarrow \mathbb{C}^n$ satisfying the local square integrability condition 
$$
\int_0^{t}\,   \vert \mathbf{f}(s)\vert^2 \, ds < \infty, \ \forall\, \ t>0 
$$
we introduce the unitary {\it Weyl displacement operator process} $\{W(\mathbf{f})(t) , t\geq 0\}$ by the relation  
\begin{equation} 
W(\mathbf{f})(t)\, e(\mathbf{u})= W(1_{[0,t]} \mathbf{f})\, e(\mathbf{u}_{t]}) \otimes e(\mathbf{u}_{[t}). \label{chap5-eq4.8}
\end{equation} 
Then $\{R_{\mathbf{f}}(t)=I_S\otimes W(\mathbf{f})(t), t\geq 0\}$ is a unitary adapted  process in $\mathcal{H}_S\otimes \mathcal{H}_R$, which obeys the quantum stochastic differential equation 
\begin{equation}
dR_{\mathbf{f}}(t)=\left\{\sum_{k=1}^n\, \left(f_k\, dA^\dag_k(t) - f_k^* dA_k(t) \right) -\frac{1}{2}\,\sum_{k=1}^n\, \vert f_k\vert^2\, dt \right\}\! R_{\mathbf{f}}(t),\ \ t\geq 0 \label{chap5-eq4.9}
\end{equation} 
with  initial condition $R_{\mathbf{f}}(0)=I_S\otimes I_{R}$. 

Choose $R_1(t)=R_{\mathbf{f}}(t)$, $R_2=I_S\otimes I_R$ in (\ref{vt}).  Then, $\{V(t)=R_{\mathbf{f}}(t)\,U(t), t\geq 0\}$,  is a unitary adapted process satisfying     
\begin{eqnarray}
dV(t)&=& \left[ dR_{\mathbf{f}}(t)\right] U(t)+ R_{\mathbf{f}}(t) \left[ dU(t)\right]+\left[ dR_{\mathbf{f}}(t) \right]\,  
\left[dU(t)\right] \nonumber \\ 
&=& \left\{\sum_{k=1}^n\, \left((L_k+f_k)\, dA^\dag_k(t) - (L^\dag_k+f^*_k)\, dA_k(t) \right) \right.\nonumber \\ 
&&  \left. - \left(iH+\frac{1}{2}\, 
\sum_{k=1}^n\,(L_k^\dag L_k+ \vert f_{k}\vert^2 + 2\, f_k^*L_k\right) \right\}\! V(t) \label{chap5-eq4.10}
\end{eqnarray}    
with intial condition $V(0)=I_S\otimes I_R$. The process $\{V(t), t\geq 0\}$ is, indeed, given by 
$$
\{V(t), t\geq 0\}=U\left(\mathbf{L}',\, H'\right),
$$
where  $\mathbf{L}'=\mathbf{L}+\mathbf{f}$ and $H'=H+\frac{1}{2i}\sum_{k=1}^n\, \left(f_k^*L_k-f_k\, L_k^\dag\right).$    

Clearly, the homomorphism $j_{t,\mathbf{f}}:  \ \mathcal{B}(\mathcal{H}_S)\longrightarrow 
\mathcal{B}(\mathcal{H}_S\otimes\mathcal{H}_R)$ defined by  
$$
j_{t,\mathbf{f}} (X) = V(t)^{\dagger} (X \otimes I_R)  V(t)
$$
satisfies the relation 
$$
j_{t,\mathbf{f}} (X)\equiv U(t)^{\dagger} (X \otimes I_R)  U(t)=j_t(X)
$$  
and hence,  the generator $\mathcal{L}$,  defined by \eqref{chap5-eq3.27}) with operators $(\mathbf{L},\, H)$, remains invariant, when $\mathbf{L}$, $H$ are replaced by $\mathbf{L}'=\mathbf{L}+\mathbf{f}$ and $H'=H+\frac{1}{2i}\, \displaystyle\sum_{k=0}^{n}(f_k^*L_k-f_k\, L_k^\dag)$ respectively. 

\noindent {\em Remark}: When $\mathbf{f}(\cdot)$ is a constant vector $\pmb{\ell}$ for all $t\geq 0$, it follows that $\mathbf{L}'=\mathbf{L}+\pmb{\ell}$ and $H'=H+\frac{1}{2i}\, \displaystyle\sum_{k=0}^{n}(\ell_k^*L_k-\ell_k\, L_k^\dag)$, thereby exhibiting the {\em translation invariance} property of the GKSL generator $\mathcal{L}$. 

\medskip 
\noindent \textbf{\large Example 2: The rotation invariance property of $\mathcal{L}$} 
\medskip

Let $t\rightarrow \mathbf{F}(t)$ be an $n\times n$  unitary matrix-valued Borel map on $\mathbb{R}_+$. Define the second quantization unitary operator process $\{\Gamma(\mathbf{F})(t), t\geq 0\}$, acting only on $\mathcal{H}_R$, by the relation 
\begin{equation} 
\Gamma(\mathbf{F})(t)\, e(\mathbf{u})=\Gamma(\mathbf{F})(t)\,e(u\otimes \pmb{\zeta})= 
e\left(u_{t]}\otimes \mathbf{F}(t)\, \pmb{\zeta}\right)\otimes e(u_{[t}\otimes \pmb{\zeta}).  \label{chap5-eq4.11}
\end{equation}
where we  use the identification $L^2(\mathbb{R}_+,\mathbb{C}^n)=L^2(\mathbb{R}_+)\otimes\mathbb{C}^n$ and choose 
$\mathbf{u}=u\otimes \pmb{\zeta}$ with $u \in  L^2(\mathbf{R}_+)$ and  $\pmb{\zeta}\in\mathbb{C}^n$. Then, 
\begin{equation} 
\Gamma(\mathbf{F})(t)\, \Omega_0= \Gamma^\dag(\mathbf{F})(t)\, \Omega_0=\Omega_0.   \label{chap5-eq4.12}
\end{equation}
Define 
\begin{equation}
R(t)=I_S\otimes \Gamma(\mathbf{F})(t),\ \ \  t\geq 0. \label{chap5-eq4.13}
\end{equation}
and choose $R_1(t)=R(t)$, $R_2(t)=R^\dag(t)$ in \eqref{chap5-eq4.2}. Then, 
$$
V(t)=R(t)\,U(t)\, R^\dag(t),\  t\geq 0.
$$  
Define the homomorphism $j_{t,\mathbf{F}}:  \ \mathcal{B}(\mathcal{H}_S)\longrightarrow \mathcal{B}(\mathcal{H}_S\otimes\mathcal{H}_R)$ by 
\begin{align}
j_{t,\mathbf{F}} (X) =& V^{\dagger}(t) (X \otimes I_R)  V(t) \nonumber \\
=& I_S\otimes \Gamma(\mathbf{F})(t)\,   U^{\dagger}(t) (X \otimes I_R)  U(t) I_S\otimes \Gamma^\dag(\mathbf{F})(t),\ \forall \ \  t\geq 0. \label{chap5-eq4.14}
\end{align}  
Then, it follows immediately from  \eqref{chap5-eq4.12} that, 
\begin{eqnarray}
\mathbb{E}_{\Omega_0} \left(j_{t,\mathbf{F}}(X)\right)&=&\mathbb{E}_{\Omega_0}\, \left(U^{\dagger}(t) (X \otimes I_R)  U(t)\right)\nonumber \\ 
&=& \mathbb{E}_{\Omega_0} \left(j_t(X)\right)=e^{t\,\mathcal{L}}(X).\label{chap5-eq4.15}
\end{eqnarray}
In other words, both   $\{U(t)\}$ and $\{V(t)=R(t)\,U(t)\, R^\dag(t)\}$ yield the irreversible dynamics of the states and observables of the quantum system with the same GKSL generator $\mathcal{L}$.      

\noindent {\em Remark}: Consider a special case of the second quantization unitary process $\{\Gamma(\mathbf{F}(t)\}$, where $\mathbf{F}(t)$ is a constant $n\times n$ unitary matrix defined by, $\mathbf{F}(t)=((u_{ij})),\ i,j=1,2,\cdots , n$ for all $t\geq 0$. Then, $\{U(t), t\geq 0\}=U(\mathbf{L},H)$ and $\{V(t), t\geq 0\}=U(\mathbf{L}',H')$, where $L'_i=\sum_{j=1}^n\, u_{ij}\, L_j, \ \ H'=H$.  The GKSL generator $\mathcal{L}$ remains invariant, when  the operator parameters $(\mathbf{L}, H)$ are replaced by $(\mathbf{L'}, H')$, thereby exhibiting the  {\em rotation invariance} property of $\mathcal{L}$. 

\section{Wiener-It\^{o}-Segal isomorphism}\label{chap5-sec5}

We shall now describe the HP quantum stochastic calculus in the Hilbert space $L^2(\mu)$, where $\mu$ is the classical Wiener  probability measure of the $n$-dimensional standard Brownian motion process $\{\mathbf{B}(t), t\geq 0\}$. To this end, we denote 
$\left\{\mathbf{B}(t)^T=\left(B_1(t), B_2(t),\cdots , B_n(t)\right)^T\right\}$ where $B_k(t),$ $1\leq k\leq n$ are $n$ independent one dimensional standard Brownian motion processes, ``$\,T\,$" denoting transpose. We introduce the exponential random variables 
\begin{align} 
\widetilde{e}(\mathbf{u})(\mathbf{B})& = {\exp}\,\left( \int_0^\infty \mathbf{u}(s)^T\, d\mathbf{B}(s)- 
\frac{1}{2}\,\int_0^\infty \mathbf{u}(s)^T\mathbf{u}(s)\, ds\right),\nonumber \\ 
& \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad \mathbf{u}\in L^2(\mathbb{R}_+)\otimes\mathbb{C}^n, \label{chap5-eq5.1}
\end{align}         
where we view $L^2(\mathbb{R}_+)\otimes \mathbb{C}^n$ also as the direct sum of $n$ copies of $L^2(\mathbb{R}_+).$  
Now, consider the correspondence 
$$
\Theta :\ e(\mathbf{u}) \rightarrow \widetilde{e}(\mathbf{u}),
$$
where $e(\mathbf{u})$ is the exponential vector  defined in Sec. \ref{chap5-sec3} (see \eqref{chap5-eq3.2}). The map $\Theta$ is scalar product preserving and so, it extends uniquely to a Hilbert space isomorphism from the Boson Fock space $\Gamma(L^2(\mathbb{R}_+)\otimes\mathbb{C}^n)$ to  $L^2(\mu)$. This is called the Wiener-It\^{o}-Segal isomorphism~\cite{key32,key33,key34}.
