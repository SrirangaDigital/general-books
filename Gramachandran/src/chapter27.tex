Abstract
\end{center}


All researchers of quantum mechanics assume that the Schr\"{o}dinger equation is the equation for
dynamics, akin to Newton's equation of motion or the Hamilton-Jacobi equation for the evolution
of action. The wavefunction $\psi(x)$ is assumed to be some way associated with a single particle,
or a single quantum history. Hence, Born's ad hoc interpretation is necessary to connect the psi-function to the statistical results of an ensemble of observations. Here I show that the Schr\"{o}dinger
equation is not the equation for dynamics, but it is in fact the equation for the evolution of
the ensemble probability density $\rho(x)$, written in terms of the single valued square root Ï‡(x)
of the probability density, \textit{with the constraint that $\rho(x)$ is that of a dynamical system}. It then
follows that the Born's rule is an exact relation $\chi \chi^{\ast} \equiv \rho$, by definition. This implies that a
matter-wave is absent in quantum mechanics; $\psi(x)$ is not the matter-wave. Neither is it the
representative of a single quantum history. The psi-function is an ensemble averaged quantity.
The true dynamical equation is a modified Hamilton's equation for the action-wave $\zeta(S)$. This
completes the Hamiltonian dynamics to a universal dynamics, with the encompassing uncertainty
relation $\Delta S \geq \hbar$. These findings define the kernel of quantum dynamics without any of the
foundational problems of interpretation or ontology, while retaining all the statistical results of
quantum mechanics.

\section{Introduction}

``\textbf{It will be impossible to answer any one question completely without at the
same time answering them all}", P. A. M. Dirac, Proc. Roy. Soc. Lond. A, Vol. 114,
243 (1927).

The Schr\"{o}dinger equation marked a decisive milestone of modern quantum mechanics
(QM), after two decades of isolated results of importance in atomic physics. The equation
was also considered as the completion of non-relativistic QM, apart from the addition of the
Born's rule. Its more detailed structure, compared to Heisenberg's earlier breakthrough of
finding the `rule of quantization', made it the basis of most discussions and the calculations
of the theory. Schr\"{o}dinger arrived at the first order equation for the time evolution of
`something like a wave' after many steps, spread over four papers in 1926, starting with a
second order wave equation that resembled conventional second order wave equations [1].
The differential equation was written for the time evolution of the ``wavefunction", which was
notionally related to, and inspired by, de Broglie's matter-wave. The Schr\"{o}dinger equation
is
\begin{equation*}
i \hbar \frac{\partial \psi (x)}{\partial t} = \hat{H} \psi (x) \tag{1}
\end{equation*}
where $\hat{H}$ is a differential operator corresponding to the Hamiltonian of the system. However,
as well known, the wavefunction or the `psi-function' $\psi (x)$ cannot be interpreted as a physical
entity is real space, though it is a function of the $3N$ coordinates of the $N$ particles in the
quantum system. It does not directly represent the material particle or a wave corresponding
to the particle, evolving in real space. Thus, the complex valued psi-function remains as
much of a mystery now as it was about a century ago. The only additional interpretational
insight was M. Born's proposal that the absolute square of the $\psi$-function, $\psi(x) \psi^{\ast}(x)$, is to
be equated to the probability density $\rho(x)$ for evaluating the statistical results of all possible
observations of the system.

Subsequent formal developments clarified the mathematical structure of QM and clearly
delineated how to use the theory for the precise calculations of ensemble averaged quantities
of interest. The generalization to the Pauli equation for the two-component `spinor' psi-
function and the further generalization to the relativistic case with the invention of the Dirac
equation completed the quantum theory of particles. The comparison with experimental
observations, and the excellent empirical agreement in every known case, suggest that the
present QM is the correct statistical description of physical effects in the microscopic atomic
world, to the tiniest scales.

I intend to take a close look at the Schr\"{o}dinger equation, to reveal its true structure
and meaning, including the real nature of the elusive `psi-function'. I will show that \textit{the
Schr\"{o}dinger equation is not the equation for dynamics}. Rather, it is the equation for the
time evolution of a probability density, written in terms of its single valued square root, with
the constraint that the probability density corresponds to the dynamics of an ensemble of
particles. In other words, the Schr\"{o}dinger equation is an ensemble equation, and not the
equation for the single particle or single quantum history. This drastically changes the basis
for the entire understanding of quantum mechanics, hitherto followed in all approaches
to the interpretation of the theory. Then the question arises immediately, what then is
the core equation of quantum dynamics?! The correct equation for dynamics is found by
modifying and completing Hamilton's equation for the evolution of the action S, to a new
equation for the true ``wavefunction of action" $\zeta(S)$, which describes the universal dynamics
of particles at all scales and all velocities \cite{chap27-key2}. The new dynamics reveals the reason for the
intrinsic uncertainty, with the new general relation $\Delta S \geq \hbar$. It is argued, from empirical
considerations, that there is no matter-wave, and that matter itself does not have any wave
property. The sole `wave' in quantum mechanics, and indeed in all mechanics, is the `action-
wave'. It is shown, with explicit demonstrations and calculations, that the new mechanics
solves the vexing problems of the collapse of the quantum state and quantum measurement,
as well as the alleged problem of nonlocality in multi-particle correlations. In addition, the
new mechanics is free of the divergence of zero-point energy in the vacuum wave modes.
With these clarifications and features, quantum mechanics seems completed, both in its
structure and in its physical interpretation, a century after its formulation. Now, we can
not only calculate with quantum mechanics, but also understand the dynamics consistently
and causally, without conceptual clashes or ambiguities.

\section{The Schr\"{o}dinger Equation}

Schr\"{o}dinger started his exploration of a wave equation, for the matter wave conjectured
by de Broglie, with the familiar differential equation for waves,
\begin{equation*}
\nabla^2 \psi (x,t) - \frac{\partial^2 \psi (x,t)}{u^2 \partial t^2} = 0 \tag{2}
\end{equation*}
where the velocity $u = E/ [2m(E - V )]^{1/2}$. With the time dependence of the $\psi$-function
that obeys the relation $E = h\nu$ limited to $\psi(t) \infty \exp \pm i2\pi \nu t$, one gets $\ddot{\psi} (t) = -4 \pi^2 E^2 \psi /h^2$.
The resulting equation with the Coulomb potential in the Hydrogen atom $V (r) = e^2 /r$,
\begin{equation*}
\nabla^2 \psi + \frac{8 \pi^2 m}{h^2} (E + e^2 / r) \psi = 0 \tag{3}
\end{equation*}
\textit{did provide the Bohr spectrum of Hydrogen atom} \cite{chap27-key1}. Since the interpretation of $\psi$ as the
matter wave of the single electron around the nucleus sort of fitted what the equation was
suggesting, the initial interpretation of the Schr\"{o}dinger equation as a wave equation repre-
senting dynamics, and its wavefunction as the matter wave in space, was widely influential.
This general identification of matter as a dual entity, \textit{as both a particle and a wave}, determined the rest of the history of the physical interpretation of QM. However, it may be noted that there was no compulsion from experiments to equate the particles with a wave,
both propagating in space; what was empirically required was the association of only the
dynamics (motion) of the particle, and the material particle itself, with an unobservable
wave-like entity, with the periodicity $\hbar$ in the action $S$.

What was Schr\"{o}dinger's route from the equation
\begin{equation*}
\nabla^2 \psi(x,t) + \frac{2m}{\hbar^2} (E-V) \psi = 0 \tag{4}
\end{equation*}
to the final Schr\"{o}dinger equation? Stated concisely, he eliminated the quantity $E$ in the
equation by writing the time derivative $\psi(t) = 2\pi i E \psi /h$. Then we get
\begin{equation*}
\nabla^2 \psi (x,t)  + \frac{2m}{\hbar^2} [-i \hbar \dot{\psi} (t)] - \frac{2m}{\hbar^2} V_{\psi} = 0 \tag{5}
\end{equation*}
which is the Schr\"{o}dinger equation
\begin{equation*}
i \hbar \frac{\partial \psi (x,t)}{\partial t} = - \frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \nabla^2 \psi (x,t) + V \psi  \tag{6}
\end{equation*}

Clearly, the logical path followed was not one that guaranteed, or even suggested, an
equation of dynamics. Note that there was no relation made between the combination
$(\nabla^2 + V )$ and an operator corresponding to the Hamiltonian of the system. The total energy
was in fact represented by the time derivative because that was obtained by replacing $E$
with $\dot{\psi}$, after assuming harmonic solutions. Also, one just assumed its general validity for
time-dependent potentials as well. Schr\"{o}dinger invoked `success' as the justification for the
procedure. However, the price paid for the success was that he had to hesitantly abandon
any acceptable physical interpretation of the psi-function and the wave equation. The first
order time derivative may remind us of the first order derivative in the celebrated Hamilton's
equation (called the Hamilton-Jacobi equation) of the action,
\begin{equation*}
\frac{\partial S (x,p,t)}{\partial t} = - H \tag{7}
\end{equation*}

But this is misleading, because there is no obvious relation between the function Ïˆ and the
action S. The reason I retraced Schr\"{o}dinger's path to the final equation was to remind
that there is no direct correspondence between the action $S(x, p, t)$ and the wavefunction
$\psi(x, t)$ in spite of the fact that Schr\"{o}dinger derived much of the motivation and guidance
from Hamilton's work while formulating a wave equation for quantum dynamics. However,
the superficial resemblance, especially the first order time derivative, has been serving as a
misdirecting factor.

During his struggle to find a physical interpretation, Schr\"{o}dinger realized that only the
product $\psi(x) \psi^{\ast}(x)$ had any clear physical meaning; he saw $e|\psi|^2$ as representing the effective
charge density of a `fuzzy' electron. Even that was beyond an interpretation consistent
with the conventional notion of localized matter. It was only after Born's interpretation of
$\psi(x)\psi^{\ast} (x)$ as a probability density, rather than a real density of any physical quantity in
space, that one could claim a satisfactory structure in the theory of QM. Then, one got the
option to keep the particle as `point' matter, and $|\psi|^2$ as referring to the (statistical) ensemble
of particles. However, it also marks a missed opportunity for a complete understanding of
the new mechanics. If $\psi(x) \psi^{\ast} (x)$ is indeed the probability density, an evolution equation
for $\psi(x)$ should most naturally be related to the time evolution of the probability density,
rather than to the dynamics of a particle! And it is known that the time evolution of the
probability density of a closed ensemble is given by a first order partial differential equation
in time, called the equation of continuity or conservation,
\begin{equation*}
\frac{\partial \rho (x,t)}{\partial t} = - \nabla \cdot (\rho \upsilon) \tag{8}
\end{equation*}

This equation does not appear to be related to either the Hamilton's equation or the
Schr\"{o}dinger equation, especially with its first order spatial derivative. However, there are
two ways in which the second spatial derivatives are implicit in the continuity equation. One
is because the dynamical velocity $\upsilon$ is related to the action $S$ in the Hamilton's equation
by the relation $p = m \upsilon =\nabla S$. Another is when the statistical ensemble has a diffusion-
like behaviour, in which case the probability current is proportional to the gradient of the
probability density, $\rho \upsilon = - D \nabla \rho$. Then
\begin{equation*}
\upsilon = - \frac{1}{\rho} D \nabla \rho  = - D \nabla (l n \rho) \tag{9}
\end{equation*}


Thus, the evolution equation for the probability density in the general case is
\begin{equation*}
\frac{\partial \rho (x,t)}{\partial t} = - \nabla \cdot (\rho \upsilon) = - \nabla \cdot \left(\frac{\rho \nabla S}{m} - D \nabla \rho \right) = - \frac{\rho}{m} \nabla^2 S - \frac{1}{m} \nabla \rho \cdot \nabla S + D \nabla^2 \rho \tag{10} 
\end{equation*}

This has second spatial derivatives on the right. But it is not an equation for dynamics. It
is explicitly an equation for the statistical ensemble and the quantity $\rho (x, t)$ characterizes
the ensemble. In fact, the structure of the Schr\"{o}dinger equation is of this kind, rather than
of the Hamilton's equation, because the time evolution of quantity is related to the spatial
derivatives of the same quantity. If indeed this is the case, then the psi-function in the
Schr\"{o}dinger equation is definitely not be the matter wave of de Broglie! When all these
aspects are evident, why do we still associate $\psi$ with a matter wave and such a wave with a
particle? We shouldn't, as the rest of the discussion will prove.

The probability density $\rho$ in the equation 8 is of course a positive quantity. Therefore,
$\rho = \psi \psi^{\ast}$ where $\psi = Ae^{i\phi}$ is complex and single valued, with $A$ positive. Then, $+\sqrt{\rho} = A$.
We call $A$ the probability amplitude. The equation 8 is equivalent to
\begin{equation*}
\frac{\partial A}{\partial t} = \frac{A}{2} \nabla \cdot \upsilon - \nabla A \cdot \upsilon \tag{11}
\end{equation*}

A diffusive term $D \nabla^2 A$ can be added to this as well, keeping the linear nature of the equation,
but its justification for the ensemble of single particle dynamics comes from another quarter,
to be explained later.

But
\begin{equation*}
\frac{\partial A}{\partial t} = \frac{\partial \psi e^{-i \phi}}{\partial t} = e^{-i \phi} \frac{\partial \psi}{\partial t} -  i \psi e^{-i \phi} \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial t}  \tag{12}
\end{equation*}

Therefore, the time evolution equation for either $A$ or $\psi$, both representing the probability
density, also contains the time derivative of the dummy phase $\phi$. However, irrespective
of this fact, $\psi$ here is the (complex) square root of the ensemble probability density and
$\partial \psi /\partial t$ is its time evolution, given by the continuity equation. Its association with a single
particle is only in the sense of a probability density (the physical quantities associated with
the particle are associated with this probability density). Anticipating the result that this
$\psi (x, t) = Ae^{i \phi}$ is indeed the wavefunction of the Schr\"{o}dinger equation, we establish the first
rigorous relation on our journey, straight from the definition.
\begin{equation*}
\psi (x, t) \psi (x, t)^{\ast} = \rho(x, t) \tag{13}
\end{equation*}

So, Born's rule connecting the wavefunction and the probability density is exact. It does
not depend on what the dummy phase physically is.

As the next step, I show that, just as $A(x, t) = + \sqrt{\rho}$, \textit{the function $\psi (x, t)$ obeys the
continuity equation for the probability density, when the system is a dynamical system}, i.e.,
when the ensemble obeys the equation of dynamics. I emphasize that the function $\psi(x, t)$
does not represent a single particle or single dynamical history. Note than $A$ and $\psi$ are
dimensionless, as $\rho$ is. Writing $\phi = S/\varepsilon$,
\begin{align*}
\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial t} & = e^{i S/\varepsilon} \frac{\partial A}{\partial t} + \frac{i}{\varepsilon} \psi \frac{\partial S}{\partial t} \\
\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial t} - \frac{i}{\varepsilon} \psi \frac{\partial S}{\partial t} & = e^{i S  / \varepsilon} \left(- \frac{A}{2} \nabla \cdot \upsilon - \nabla A \cdot \upsilon + D \nabla^2 A \right) \tag{14}
\end{align*}

The spatial derivatives of $\psi$ are
\begin{align*}
\nabla \psi & = \frac{i}{\varepsilon} Ae^{iS/\varepsilon} \nabla S + e^{iS/\varepsilon} \nabla A\\
\nabla^2 \psi & = \frac{i}{\varepsilon} Ae^{iS/ \varepsilon} \nabla^2 S + \frac{i}{\varepsilon} \frac{i}{\varepsilon} Ae^{iS/ \varepsilon} (\nabla S)^2 + \frac{i}{\varepsilon} e^{eS/\varepsilon} \nabla S \cdot \nabla A + e^{i S /\varepsilon} \nabla^2 A + \frac{i}{\varepsilon} e^{iS/\varepsilon } \nabla S \cdot \nabla A \\
& = \frac{i}{\varepsilon} Ae^{is/\varepsilon} \nabla^2 S + \frac{2i}{\varepsilon} e^{iS/\varepsilon} \nabla S \cdot \nabla A + e^{i S/\varepsilon} \nabla^2 A - \frac{1}{\varepsilon^2} A e^{iS/\varepsilon} (\nabla S)^2 \tag{15}
\end{align*}

Now, multiplying by $i\varepsilon /2m$ gives
\begin{equation*}
\frac{i\varepsilon}{2m} \nabla^2 \psi + \frac{i}{\varepsilon} A e^{iS/\varepsilon} \frac{(\nabla S)^2}{2m} = e^{iS/\varepsilon} \left(\frac{-A}{2m} \nabla^2 S - \frac{1}{m} \nabla A \cdot \nabla S + \frac{i\varepsilon}{2m} \nabla^2 A \right) \tag{16}
\end{equation*}

Since, $\upsilon = \nabla S/m$, the expressions on the R.H.S in the equations 14 and 16 are equal,
which is the time evolution of the square root of the probability density, $e^{iS/ \varepsilon} \dfrac{\partial A}{\partial t}$. Therefore,
\begin{equation*}
\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial t} - \frac{i}{\varepsilon} \psi \frac{\partial S}{\partial t} = \frac{i\varepsilon}{2m} \nabla^2 \psi + \frac{i}{\varepsilon} \frac{(\nabla S)^2}{2m} \tag{17}
\end{equation*}

We can already see that for a free particle, the second terms on both sides cancel, because
the dynamics obeys the Hamilton's equation
\begin{equation*}
\frac{\partial S}{\partial t} = -H = -p^2 / 2m \tag{18}
\end{equation*}
and $\nabla S = p$. Thus, if the probability density is that of the dynamics of free particles, then
the Hamilton's equation is a constraint for the time evolution of the probability density.
Then,
\begin{equation*}
\frac{\partial\psi}{\partial t} = \frac{i\varepsilon}{2m} \nabla^2 \psi \tag{19}
\end{equation*}

Considering an arbitrary potential $V (x, t)$,
\begin{equation*}
\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial t} + \frac{i}{\varepsilon} \psi V (x,t) - \frac{i}{\varepsilon} \psi \frac{\partial S}{\partial t} = \frac{i\varepsilon}{2m} \nabla^2 \psi + \frac{i}{\varepsilon} \psi \left( \frac{(\nabla S)^2}{2m} + V (x,t)\right)  \tag{20}
\end{equation*}

The last terms are again eliminated on both sides, by adding the scaled V to the expressions.

The surviving part is
\begin{equation*}
\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial t} + \frac{i}{\varepsilon} \psi V (x,t) = \frac{i \varepsilon}{2m} \nabla^2 \psi \tag{21}
\end{equation*}


This evolution equation for the square root of the probability density of the dynamics of
particles, $\psi = Ae^{i\phi}$, where $\phi$ is the scaled action $S/\varepsilon$ of a dynamical system, is indeed the
Schr\"{o}dinger equation. This can be rearranged to the standard form,
\begin{equation*}
i \varepsilon \frac{\partial \psi}{\partial t} = - \frac{\varepsilon^2}{2m} \nabla^2 \psi + V \psi \tag{22}
\end{equation*}

Clearly $\psi$ has nothing to do with a ``matter wave", nor does it represent the single dynamical
history \cite{chap27-key2}. It pertains to a statistical ensemble of single dynamical histories. So, clearly the
Schr\"{o}dinger equation is not a single particle dynamical equation, in contrast to an equation
like $dp/dt = F$. What we have accomplished is the derivation of the Schr\"{o}dinger equation
from first principles, clarifying its ensemble nature and completely revealing the physical
nature of the function $\psi (x, t) = \sqrt{\rho}e^{i\phi}$. The scale relevant for particle dynamics is obtained
from experiments, as $\varepsilon = \hbar$.

\section{The $\psi$-Function in the Schr\"{o}dinger Equation}%% III

From the point of view of physics, it is very important to realize that the Schr\"{o}dinger
quantum mechanics does not concern a matter-wave, or even a single piece of matter in
dynamics. Obviously, the general impression created by the historical development towards
this equation, that the $\psi$-function is directly associated with single quantum history and
the matter wave speculated by de Broglie, are misplaced, as shown by the discussion and
derivation above. It is also clear why all the subsequent attempts at a palatable interpre-
tation of the $\psi$-function and the equation failed. If an ensemble equation for probability
density is mistaken for a dynamical equation of a single particle, the gap is too large to be
bridged by any interpretation. The only voice that came close to pointing to the correct path
was of Einstein, when he repeatedly suggested that the problems of interpretation could be
avoided if the $\psi$-function represented the ensemble \cite{chap27-key3}, \cite{chap27-key4}. However, that was not enough, as
the derivation here shows. The necessary constraint that the probability density pertains to
dynamics is implemented through the hybrid nature of the $\psi$-function, containing $\sqrt{\rho}$ and
the common scaled action $S/\hbar$, in the phase factor. This factor is common to all members
of the ensemble, if it is a pure state. Otherwise, this also will be averaged as $(S/\hbar)$, and
may even be zero, as in an incoherent mixture.
\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.75]{src/images/chap27/1.eps}
\caption{FIG. 1: Proof against a matter-wave in real space: A) While the fact of detection as a particle is
unambiguous, any proposal of matter-wave in both paths, with each branch possesing the entire
mass, charge etc. violates all conservation laws. B) However, there is clear empirical evidence for
a physical entity, which is not a matter-wave, that is present in both paths in space, for every
particle. The evidence is in the fact that the observable state at the output port depends on what
physical element or interaction is present in both paths, for every single particle.}
\end{figure}


Having made the seemingly incredible assertion that there are no matter-waves in real
physical situations of quantum mechanics, one is obliged to give some empirical support to
the claim, apart from the demonstration in the derivation of the SchrÃ¶dinger equation. This
is in fact easy. Consider the configuration of a Mach-Zehnder interferometer for atoms with
widely separated paths. The $\psi$-function of quantum mechanics gives the correct results for
all observable features, whether it is in the individual paths or in the interference zone, after
the beam-combiner. The $\psi$-function splits at the beam splitter, to be divided in the two
paths. But, what is clear is that the particle cannot be in both paths without violating
all fundamental conservation laws! Associated with each branch of the $\psi$-function, there is
the intrinsic properties of the particle in full (mass, electric charge, spin etc.), not divided
or smeared out. Therefore, a virtual copy in each branch would violate the conservation
laws, and a division of any sort would not be consistent with the general empirical results.
Therefore, it should be obvious that the $\psi$-function is not the matter wave, even in this
simple single particle situation. But, the $\psi$-function is all what is required to reproduce
all observable results. Hence, we can conclude that no matter-wave is involved in quantum
mechanics \cite{chap27-key2}. Instead, what is present as the $\psi$-function is an ensemble entity. Therefore,
we need to find a missing element; it is operative in each dynamical history, but it is not
the nonexistent matter-wave or the ensemble $\psi$-function!

In fact, the exact context in which the wave character is apparent in dynamics was
mentioned by Einstein, in his article `Physics and Reality' [3]: ``Experiments on interference
made with particle rays have given a brilliant proof that \textit{the wave character of phenomena of
motion} as assumed by the theory does, really, correspond to the facts." I have italicized the
crucial phrase; the wave character is not of the matter, but of the `phenomenon of motion'.

In the same article, Einstein stated another crucial insight about the $\psi$-function, which I
proved now from the analysis of the SchrÃ¶dinger equation. Einstein wrote, â€œThe $\psi$-function
does not in any way describe a condition which could be that of a single system; it relates
rather to many systems, to `an ensemble of systems' in the sense of statistical mechanics.
If, except for certain special cases, the $\psi$-function furnishes only statistical data concerning
measurable magnitudes, the reason lies not only in the fact that the operation of measuring
introduces unknown elements, which can be grasped only statistically, but also because of
the very fact that the $\psi$-function does not, in any sense, describe the condition of one single
system. The Schr\"{o}dinger equation determines the time variations which are experienced
by the ensemble of systems which may exist with or without external action on the single
system." It cannot be stated more transparently.

It is now clear why quantum mechanics has only statistical predictions; the simple reason
is that its fundamental equation is an equation for the evolution of the probability density.
But, we have not yet touched the cardinal feature of quantum mechanics, the phenomenon
of interference of dynamical possibilities. Why is the probability density structured with
interference? How can it happen without a `wave'? What is the reason for the intrinsic
irreducible uncertainty? We will discuss and answer these questions now.

\section{Then, What is the Equation of Dynamics?}%% 4

Having shown that the SchrÃ¶dinger equation is not the dynamical equation, we have
the new task of finding the equation that governs the single particle dynamics. Of course
we know empirically that it cannot be very far from Newtonâ€™s equation, which may also
be expressed in its Lagrangian form or the Hamiltonian form. Since, we found that the
hybrid character of the $\psi$-function involves the action, we now focus on its physical role
and proceed. Here, we need to go all the way back to W. R. Hamilton's insightful paper
in 1832 that introduced the principle of stationary action, generalizing from Fermatâ€™s least
action principle for optics \cite{chap27-key5}. In that paper, he developed a universal and ``general method
for expressing the paths of light, and of the planets". Hamilton also discussed the rationale
involved in the principle, through Huygensâ€™ theory of wave optics. In the subsequent papers
\cite{chap27-key6} that described the method for mechanics based on the `characteristic function', or the
action function $S(x, t)$, he wrote the general equation for dynamics as
\begin{equation*}
\frac{\partial S}{\partial t} = -H, \quad H = T + V  \tag{23}
\end{equation*}

The momentum is derived from the action as $\partial S/ \partial x = p$. The equation was called the
Hamiltonian equation by C. G. J. Jacobi, who developed it further mathematically \cite{chap27-key7}.
However, this equation does not explicitly acknowledge the original physical feature of action
that was the core reason for its property of being `stationary' or, extremal! The central
property that enables interference, which results in the dynamics along the path of stationary
action, is precisely \textit{the physical manifestation of action as a wave-like entity}. Otherwise, there
is no way the dynamical possibilities can cancel each other. The principle is operative because
the action is physically manifest in a wave property where the phase of the wave is the scaled
action. With this insight, the entire path is clear. As it stands, the Hamilton's equation
is not complete. Instead of an equation for the action, the correct and complete equation
that incorporates the Huygen's principle should have been for an oscillatory function of the
action. Hence, I complete Hamilton's action mechanics by modifying the equation to a new
universal form \cite{chap27-key2}
\begin{equation*}
\frac{\partial \zeta(S)}{\partial t} = - \frac{i}{\epsilon} H \zeta \tag{24}
\end{equation*}
where the function $\zeta(x, t) = \exp(iS(x, t)/\varepsilon)$. I call this function the `action-wave', since it
has a direct physical presence. This equation is the key step in the correct description of a
single particle, of a single dynamical history, in the reconstructed universal dynamics. The
parameter $\varepsilon$ is the fundamental scale of action that is to be determined empirically. This
equation contains Hamilton's equation $\partial S/\partial t = -H$.

The form of this single particle equation, without an ensemble `probability amplitude'
$A = + \sqrt{\rho}$ in it, shows why there was the prevalent confusion about the Schr\"{o}dinger equation
as a dynamical equation. The similarity is only partial though. This equation for the
time evolution of action does not involve the average over the ensemble. The Schr\"{o}dinger
equation is for the time evolution of a different entity, $\psi = \sqrt{\rho} \exp(iS/\varepsilon)$, represeting the
whole ensemble.
\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.65]{src/images/chap27/2.eps}
\caption{FIG. 2: The difference between the path in the conventional Hamiltonian dynamics (A) and in
the new universal mechanics (B). In both schemes, the path has the stationary action $\delta S = 0$.
But factually, as indicated in the panel (B), the path has the intrinsic uncertainty $\Delta S \geq \hbar$ and a
nonzero concentration of action $\nabla^2 S$, which drives the diffusion (dephasing) of the action.}
\end{figure}

\textit{The first feature I note is that the action-wave is necessarily complex valued}. For, the relation between the first order time evolution and the Hamiltonian involves second order spatial
derivatives. Therefore, the dynamical equation cannot be built on a real periodic function
like cos($S/\varepsilon$) or on a real linear combination of sinusoidal functions; the action wave needs
both quadratures as a complex valued function, $cos(S/\varepsilon) + i \sin(S/\varepsilon)$. This is easily seen for
a constant potential, $H = V$. If $\zeta(S) \sim \cos (S/\varepsilon)$, then $\partial \zeta/\partial t \sim \sin (S/\varepsilon) \partial S/\partial t$, whereas
the right side is just $iV \cos (S/\varepsilon)$, which does not make sense. Therefore, the fundamental
equation for dynamics involves complex numbers because complex valued action waves are
the basis of dynamics at all scales. This feature is then \textit{inherited} by quantum mechanics.
The action-wave has unit amplitude, dictated by the dynamical equations $\partial S/\partial t = -H$ and
$\partial S/\partial x = p$.

We note the immediate main result that the new Hamiltonian action-wave equation
predicts intrinsic indeterminism in dynamics at all scales. The fact that the action is
involved in dynamics in the form $\exp(iS/\varepsilon)$ implies that the action is specified only up to
the scale $\varepsilon$. This does not mean that the action cannot be smaller than $\varepsilon$ or that it cannot be
arranged to be of a precise value in some dynamical arrangement. What I mean is that the
action $S$ is uncertain to $\varepsilon$ when no specific arrangement is made to define it precisely. This
will be explained quantitatively, with an example, later. Then, the equation itself contains
the stochastic element. With $H = (p^2 /2m) + V$, and $p = \partial S/\partial x$ we get,
\begin{align*}
i \varepsilon \frac{\partial \zeta (S)}{\partial t} & = \left(-\zeta \frac{\partial S}{\partial t} \right) = \left(-\frac{\varepsilon^2}{2m} \nabla^2 + V \right) \zeta = \zeta \left(\frac{p^2}{2m}  + V\right) - \zeta \frac{i\varepsilon}{2m} \nabla^2 S \tag{25}\\
\frac{\partial S}{\partial t} & = - H + \frac{i \varepsilon}{2m} \nabla^2 S\tag{26} 
\end{align*}

In addition to the familiar Hamiltonian mechanics in the first term, there is an additional
term proportional to $\varepsilon$ and to the \textit{concentration of the action in space}, $\nabla^2 S$. The equation
is the single particle, single dynamical history equation. Hence, this term points to the
variations in an ensemble of action-waves, for the dynamics of a single particle. \textit{When $\varepsilon$ is
tiny, this term is negligible. But it will become significant for microscopic dynamics}. To see
this clearly, consider the situation when $p \simeq 0$, and no potential. Then, we get
\begin{equation*}
\frac{\partial S}{\partial t} = \frac{i\varepsilon}{2m} \nabla^2 S \tag{27}
\end{equation*}

Though this resembles the diffusion equation, there is only one particle here and there is no
real diffusion possible. Also, the diffusing variable is not a density of particles here! What
is diffusing is the action itself. (Note that this is not the Schr\"{o}dinger equation, though it
resembles it. This is an equation for action when the Hamiltonian is zero). Now we see what
is the source of the small term diffusion-like time evolution of the probability amplitude,
$D \nabla^2 A$, with the imaginary diffusion constant $D = i \hbar /2m$. The dephasing of the action
waves in the equation 27 is the reason for that term.

The physical picture of new dynamics is then the following. The particle is indivisible,
and always localized. It has a dynamics determined by the action, with $\nabla S = p$, where
the action evolves according to the modified Hamilton's equation. The action is manifest in
dynamics as an entity with a periodicity defined by the scale $\hbar$. The action of the particle
(system) is defined with the intrinsic uncertainty of $\hbar$. The true and accurate statement of
the uncertainty principle, applicable to all scales of dynamics, is then $\Delta S  \geq \hbar$. The division
of $\Delta S$ into $\Delta p \Delta x$, $\Delta E \Delta t$ etc. are less precise statements of the fundamental uncertainty.
Since the action is the product of a dynamical quantity and the corresponding coordinate,
the division is justified, but it is not rigorous. The correct statement of the uncertainty
principle is just that the action is uncertain to $\hbar$ or larger.

The new equation of dynamics suggests that the wave in dynamics is then the wave
of action, represented by the function $\zeta (S) = \exp(iS/\varepsilon)$. Since we know from experiments
that there is some physical entity which encodes the physical characteristics of the particle
in the multiple paths (possibilities), it can only be the action wave. This is consistent will
all empirical facts and it has none of the vexing interpretational issues that people have
faced and are unable to deal with. Now let us see how every foundational physical issue of
quantum mechanics has dissolved away.

\section{Quantum Mechanics Without Collapse}%%% 5

The problem of the collapse of the $\psi$-function arose because the $\psi$-function was always
interpreted as representing a single dynamical history. Therefore, a state that is a superposition of two states like
\begin{equation*}
|\psi \rangle = a |S1 \rangle + b |S2 \rangle \tag{28}
\end{equation*}
was interpreted to become, or \textit{collapse to $|\psi' \rangle = |S1 \rangle$  or $|S2 \rangle$, in each realization of the
dynamics}. Then, the dynamics has to restart with a new $\psi$-function, causing discontinuity
in the Schr\"{o}dinger evolution. Also, when interpreted as a matter-wave, or anything related to a real presence in space, this reduction implies the instantaneous disappearance of such an entity from every other possibility, including different paths and locations in space. 
Therefore, the need for such collapse, in standard QM, is a severe unresolved problem.

However, I have shown now that the $\psi$-function pertains to the ensemble. Then, it is
clear that there is no `superposition' of the \textit{states of the particle}, nor is any reduction of
the function during each observation; a probability density of the ensemble does not change
during each realization of its possible stochastic results! The superposition is only for the
action waves, and not for the physical state of the particle. This single physical feature
of the new mechanics is the only central fact to be understood for the solution of any
foundational issue. The particle is either in the state $|S1 \rangle$ or in the state $|S2\rangle$, and never
in a superposition, in each dynamical history, and that is what we observe. I reiterate that
a superposition of particle (matter) states blatantly violates all conservation laws, because
a general superposition would then include formally (mathematically) the situation of the
particle being in two spatially separated paths. The particle is already in the path where
it is observed, with an uncertainty of its action amounting to $\hbar$, and only that much. The
detection of the particle interrupts only the action wave in that particular path. It does not
cause any change in the propagation of the action waves in any other possibility. Since the
action waves carry only action, and no energy or momentum, none of the physical quantities
needs the reassigning, as it is necessary in standard quantum mechanics with the device of
the `collapse of the wavefunction'. We have solved the core difficulty of standard quantum
mechanics and have removed its fundamental arbitrariness and discontinuity. Now we need
to verify that the core property of interference happens because of the overlap of the action
waves in the two paths. This is the step that was missing from Einsteinâ€™s advocacy of the
interpretation of the $\psi$-function as pertaining to the ensemble.

The coefficients in the $\psi$-function are $a = + \sqrt{\rho_1}$ and $b = + \sqrt{\rho_2}$ (the sign from any phase
belongs to the action waves and not to the real amplitudes, which are ensemble quantities).
Here the (discrete) probabilities $\rho_1$ and $\rho_2$ that determine the division of the particles in the
two possibilities depend on the experimental configuration, like the width of the slits etc.
The same configuration determines the division of the action as well, into $ae^{iS/\hbar}$ and $be^{iS/\hbar}$.
After the dynamical evolution, the action waves combine as
\begin{equation*}
\zeta(S) = ae^{iS(a)/\hbar} + be^{iS (b)/\hbar} \tag{29}
\end{equation*}

The intensity is
\begin{align*}
\zeta (S) \zeta (S)^{\ast} & = a^2 + b^2 + abe^{-iS (a) /\hbar + iS (b)/\hbar} + abe^{+ S (a)/\hbar - iS (b)/\hbar}  \\
& = a^2 + b^2 + ab \left[e^{\frac{i}{\hbar} (S(b) - S(a))} + e^{\frac{i}{\hbar}(S(b) - S (a))} \right] \tag{30}\\
& = \rho_1 + \rho_2 + 2 \sqrt{\rho_1 \rho_2} \cos  (S (b)) / \hbar - S (a) / \hbar
\end{align*}
