\begin{abstract}
In this work, we identify the mixed symmetric separable states with exchangeable states. We also identify the probability distribution function characterizing the mixed symmetric separable states in the context of tomography with a unique probability distribution function, namely the $P$ function, with the aid of quantum de Finetti theorem. In the end, we explicitly calculate the Informationally complete Positive Operator Valued Measure(POVM) elements for spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ systems which might be of potential use in the laboratory.

\section{Introduction}\label{chap27-sec1}

In physics, nature of a system is understood based on the measurement results of a small number of systems belonging to an ensemble rather than making measurements on all the systems of the ensemble. For example, in order to understand the random nature of radioactivity, one need not observe every radioactive nucleus. In other words, a limited number of local measurements is used to derive the general physical law. But how can such an idea be justified ? What are the underlying facts and assumptions ? To answer these questions Renner \cite{chap27-key1} considers the following \textbf{tomography problem} : Let $S_{1},\cdots,S_{N}$ be $N$ subsystems of a large composite system and assume that individual experiments are performed on $k$ of the subsystems, $S_{1},\cdots,S_{k}$, for $k<<N$. The goal is to infer the physical state of the remaining $N-k$ subsystems, based on this experimental data. Further Renner\cite{chap27-key1} concludes that the \textbf{tomography problem} can be solved under the sole assumption that the overall system is symmetric under the permutations of the $N$ subsystems. Italian mathematician Bruno de Finetti was the first to study the above mentioned problem for the classical probabilistic systems assuming the permutation symmetry among the subsystems of the classical state \cite{chap27-key2},\cite{chap27-key3}. Later the idea of de Finetti was extended to quantum systems \cite{chap27-key4}--\cite{chap27-key7}.

We take up the study of permutationally symmetric states, in the light of quantum de Finetti theorem. Caves \cite{chap27-key8} et.\ al., have given the proof of quantum de Finetti representation theorem from the point of view of information based formulation of the quantum state tomography which we follow to analyze the mixed symmetric separable states. 

Here, for the sake of completeness, a brief discussion of classical and quantum de Finetti representation theorem is elucidated followed by quantum Bayes rule. The relationship between the mixed symmetric separable states and the quantum de Finetti theorem is discussed and found that the probability distribution characterizing the mixed symmetric separable states is unique and is none other than Glauber's $P$ function. An explicit calculation of the minimal informationally complete POVM elements for spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ system is given which can be used to find the updated probability distribution through quantum de Finetti theorem.

\section{Classical de Finetti Theorem}\label{chap27-sec2}

Before understanding the quantum version of the de Finetti theorem, it is better to go through the classical version of the theorem as a starting point. In this section, the maxim of the late E. T. Jaynes \cite{chap27-key9} and hence of Carlton M. Caves et.\ al.\ \cite{chap27-key8} is followed.

According to Jaynes, the difference of opinion between the information point of view and objectivist point of view is not new in quantum mechanics. Similarly, in classical probability theory, the difference of opinion is between subjective(Bayesian) and objective interpretation. In subjective or Bayesian interpretation, probabilities are considered to be measure of one's belief reflecting one's state of knowledge.

Following Caves et.\ al.\ \cite{chap27-key8}, let us take up an example to clear the above said concept. Consider a dice with face values $1 \cdots 6$. For a player who is an objectivist, the probability of getting each face value from $1 \cdots 6$ is $\frac{1}{6}$. For a player who is a subjectivist, in the sense that he possibly possesses some prior information about the dice or the experiment so that he can predict the outcome, probability will be peaked around some set of numbers. Newtonian mechanics allows a Bayesian interpreter to calculate the probabilities with certainty.

Now, to get an idea about quantum state tomography problem, consider an experiment of tossing a dice $N$ times. Each time, let the expected outcome is random from the set $\alpha_{n} \in 1, 2 \cdots k$, where $n = 1 \cdots N$. That means there are $N$ random variables each of which can have a value from $1 \cdots k$.

From the objectivist point of view, the probability of the above described multitrial experiment is given by an independent, identically distributed (i.i.d) distribution,
$$
p(\alpha_{1} \cdots \alpha_{N}) = p_{\alpha_{1}} \cdots p_{\alpha_{N}} = p_{1}^{n_{1}} p_{2}^{n_{2}} \cdots p_{k}^{n_{k}}
$$ 
where $n_{j}$ and $p_{j} (j= 1 \cdots k)$ represents the number of times the outcome $j$ has occured and probability of getting $j$ value respectively. Whereas a  subjectivist/Bayesian interpreter, starts with a distribution, not generally an i.i.d and then tries to update the distribution with the help of measurement outcomes. But the choice of initial distribution function itself is a difficult task. It is believed that one or more features of experiment/problem often stand out and useful in choosing the distribution function. In this experiment, stand out feature is that all the trials are equivalent. In other words, trials are permutationally invariant. That gives the hint to choose a distribution function which represents the permutational symmetry of the trials. de Finetti called this property of permutational symmetry as `exchangeability'.

Mathematically, exchangeability can be defined in two steps:

A probability distribution $p(\alpha_{1}, \alpha_{2} \cdots \alpha_{N} )$ is symmetric if it is invariant under permutation of its arguments, i.e., 
$$ 
p(\alpha_{\pi(1)}, \alpha_{\pi(2)}, \cdots \alpha_{\pi(N)}) = p (\alpha_{1}, \alpha_{2}, \cdots \alpha_{N})
$$ 
for any permutation $\pi$ of the set $1, \cdots ,N$.

The probability distribution $p(\alpha_{1}, \alpha_{2} \cdots \alpha_{N})$ is called exchangeable (infinitely exchangeable) if it is symmetric and if for any integer $S > 0$, there is a symmetric distribution $p_{N+S} (\alpha_{1}, \alpha_{2} \cdots \alpha_{N+S})$ such that
$$ 
p(\alpha_{1}, \alpha_{2}, \cdots \alpha_{N}) = \sum_{\alpha_{N+1},\cdots \alpha_{N+S}} p_{N+S} (\alpha_{1}, \alpha_{2} \cdots \alpha_{N+S}).
$$
Now, According to Caves et.\ al.\ \cite{chap27-key8}, the Classical de Finetti theorem for random variables can be stated as,

If a probability distribution $p(\alpha_{1}, \alpha_{2}, \cdots \alpha_{N})$ is exchangeable, then it can be uniquely written in the form
$$
p(\alpha_{1}, \alpha_{2}, \cdots \alpha_{N}) = \int P(\textbf{p}) p_{\alpha_{1}} p_{\alpha_{2}} \cdots p_{\alpha_{N}}  dp = \int P(\textbf{p}) p_{1}^{n_{1}} p_{2}^{n_{2}} \cdots p_{k}^{n_{k}} dp
$$ 
where $\textbf{p} = (p_{1}, p_{2}, \cdots, p_{k} )$ and $\int P(\textbf{p}) d\textbf{p} = 1$.


\section{Quantum de Finetti Theorem}\label{chap27-sec3}

Now let us look into the Bayesian approach in information based quantum state tomography as elucidated by Caves et.\ al.\ \cite{chap27-key8} Similar to the classical Bayesian interpreter, the experimenter assigns a prior quantum state to the joint system of $N$ subsystems which is under measurement. Here too choosing the prior state is a daunting task unless the exchangeability is assumed.

The definition of exchangeability in the quantum case proceeds in two steps just like in the classical case:
The N-partite state $\rho^{N}$ is called symmetric if $\pi \rho^{N} \pi^{\dagger} = \rho^{N}$ where $\pi$, is a permutation operator.

Secondly, the state $\rho^{N}$ is called exchangeable if it is symmetric and if for any $S > 0$, there is a symmetric state $\rho^{N+S}$ of $N+S$ systems such that the marginal density operator for $N$ systems is $\rho^{N}$
$$
\rho^{N} = tr_{S} \rho^{N+S}
$$ 
where the trace is taken over the additional $S$ systems.

We observe that the mixed symmetric separable states also satisfy the above conditions and hence can be called exchangeable state.

Thus according to Caves et.\ al.\ \cite{chap27-key8}, Quantum de Finetti theorem can be stated as follows:
Any exchangeable quantum state of N systems can be uniquely written as 
$$
\rho^{N} = \int_{D_{d}} P(\rho) \rho \otimes \rho \otimes \cdots \otimes \rho\,d\rho
$$ 
where $P(\rho) \geq 0$ and $\int_{D_{d}} P(\rho) d\rho = 1$ is unique probability distribution with $d\rho$ being a suitable measure on density operator space $D_{d}$.

Note that Renner \cite{chap27-key1} in his work, calls the state $\rho^{N}$ of an $N$-partite system independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) if $N$ parts are identical copies of some prototype state $\sigma$, i.e., formally, $\rho^{N} = \sigma^{\otimes N}$. Also note that any i.i.d. state is a symmetric state.

\section{Quantum Bayes Rule}\label{chap27-sec4}

If the initial state of the experiment is  $\rho^{N+S}$ which is infinitely exchangeable, from de Finetti theorem, one can write 
$$
\rho^{N+S} = \int P(\rho) \rho^{\otimes(N+S)}
$$ 
with $P(\rho)$ being a unique probability distribution and $\rho^{\otimes(N+S)}$ is $N+S$ fold tensor product of some prototype state $\rho$.

If $N$ systems are measured with particular measurement outcome sequence of length, namely $\alpha = (\alpha_{1} \cdots \alpha_{N})$, post measurement state is given by 
$$
\rho^{S} = \int P(\rho|\alpha) \rho^{\otimes S}
$$ 
\cite{chap27-key10} where $P(\rho|\alpha)$ is updated unique probability distribution. From Baysian probability, the updated probability distribution is given by 
$$
P(\rho|\alpha) = \frac{P(\rho)P(\alpha|\rho)}{\int P(\rho)P(\alpha|\rho) d\rho}
$$ 
where
$$
P(\alpha|\rho) = (\rho^{N} E_{\alpha_{1}} \otimes E_{\alpha_{2}} \otimes \cdots \otimes E_{\alpha_{N}})
$$
where $E_{\alpha_{1}} \otimes E_{\alpha_{2}} \otimes \cdots \otimes E_{\alpha_{N}}$ form a set of informationally complete Positive Operator Valued Measure (POVM) elements with $\alpha_{n} = 1, 2, \cdots$, $d^{2}$, $n = 1, \cdots,N$. It is valid to think $N$ repeated measurements of a set of POVM's as a single measurement on the Hilbert space $H_{d}^{\otimes N} = H_{d} \otimes \cdots \otimes H_{d}$.

\section{Quantum de Finetti Theorem and Mixed Symmetric Separable States}\label{chap27-sec5}

Now let us see what happens if we choose $\rho^{N}$ to be a mixed symmetric separable state given by our proposition 2 given in \cite{chap27-key11} i.e, 
$$
\rho^{N} = \sum_{i} \lambda_{i} \rho_{i} \otimes \rho_{i} \cdots \otimes \rho_{i}.
$$

The mixed symmetric separable state is chosen because it is exchangeable.

Then, 
\begin{align*}
P(\alpha|\rho) & = (\sum_{i} \lambda_{i} \rho_{i} \otimes \rho_{i} \cdots \otimes \rho_{i} (E_{\alpha_{1}} \otimes E_{\alpha_{2}} \otimes \cdots \otimes E_{\alpha_{N}})) \\
P(\alpha|\rho) & = \sum_{i} \lambda_{i} (\rho_{i} E_{\alpha}(1)) (\rho_{i} E_{\alpha}(2)) \cdots (\rho_{i} E_{\alpha}(N)).
\end{align*}

Under continuum limit,
\makeatletter
\counterwithout{equation}{chapter}
\makeatother
\begin{equation} 
P(\alpha|\rho) = \int \lambda(\theta,\phi) (\rho(\theta,\phi) E_{\alpha}(1)) (\rho (\theta,\phi) E_{\alpha}(2)) \cdots (\rho (\theta,\phi) E_{\alpha}(N)) d\Omega. \label{chap27-eq1}
\end{equation}

From classical de Finetti theorem, since $P(\alpha|\rho)$ is exchangeable \cite{chap27-key10}, we have 
\begin{equation} 
P(\alpha|\rho) = \int G(p) p_{\alpha}(1) p_{\alpha}(2) \cdots p_{\alpha}(N) dp \label{chap27-eq2}
\end{equation} 
where $G(p)$ is the unique probability distribution with some unique operator satisfying 
$$
tr(A_{p}E_{\alpha}) = p_{\alpha}, \alpha= 1 \cdots d^{2}.
$$

On comparing the equations (\eqref{chap27-eq1}) and (\eqref{chap27-eq2}), we conclude that in tomography, post measured $N$ qubit mixed symmetric separable state $\rho^{N}$ is characterized by a unique probability distribution function $\lambda(\theta,\phi)$ \cite{chap27-key11}. Note that the distribution function $\lambda(\theta,\phi)$ was identified with $P$ function \cite{chap27-key12}. Hence, the unique probability distribution function mentioned in the quantum de Finetti theorem is a $P$ function.

\section{Informationally Complete POVM for Spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ Systems}\label{chap27-sec6}

A special type of a set of POVMs \cite{chap27-key8} $E_{\alpha}$, which has precisely $d^{2}$ linearly independent elements specifies an unique operator $A$, for a given set of outcome probabilities $p_{\alpha}$, such that $p_{\alpha}= (AE_{\alpha})$. An elegant way of constructing such minimal informationally complete POVMs is given by Caves et.\ al.\ \cite{chap27-key8}. Here explicit calculation of the POVM elements for spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ system is shown in detail which can be used to calculate the updated probability distributions in the case of $N$ qubit systems.

Let 
\begin{equation*}
|e_{1} \rangle = 
\begin{bmatrix}
1\\
0 
\end{bmatrix},\quad
|e_{2} \rangle = 
\begin{bmatrix}
1\\
0 
\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation*}
be the complete orthonormal basis of spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ system. Now, a set of linearly independent projectors can be constructed as,
\begin{align*}
\pi_{1} = |{e_{1}}\rangle \langle{e_{1}}|,\qquad & \pi_{2} = |{e_{2}}\rangle \langle{e_{2}}| \\
\pi_{3} = \frac{1}{2}|{e_{1}}+{e_{2}}\rangle \langle{e_{1}}+{e_{2}}|,\qquad & \pi_{4} = \frac{1}{2}|{e_{1}}+i{e_{2}}\rangle \langle{e_{1}}-i{e_{2}}|.
\end{align*}
Explicitly,
\begin{align*}
\pi_{1} =
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0  \\ 
0 & 0 \\ 
\end{bmatrix}
,\quad & \pi_{2}= 
\begin{bmatrix}
0 & 0\\ 
0 & 1\\ 
\end{bmatrix}\\
\pi_{3} = \frac{1}{2}
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 1 \\ 
1 & 1\\ 
\end{bmatrix}
,\quad & \pi_{4} = \frac{1}{2}
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & -i \\ 
i & 1\\ 
\end{bmatrix}.
\end{align*}

Since $\sum_{i}^{4} \pi_{i} \neq I$, construct a positive semi definite operator $G$ as,  
\begin{align*}
G & = \sum_{\alpha=1}^{4} \pi_{\alpha}\\
G & = 
\begin{bmatrix}
2 & \frac{e^{-i\frac{\pi}{4}}}{\sqrt{2}}\\ 
\frac{e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}}}{\sqrt{2}} & 2\\ 
\end{bmatrix}
\end{align*}

Applying the linear transformation $X = G^{-\frac{1}{2}}X G^{-\frac{1}{2}}$ to $G$, one can find a valid decomposition of the identity,
$$
I = \sum_{\alpha=1}^{4} G^{-\frac{1}{2}} \pi_{\alpha} G^{-\frac{1}{2}}
$$
where 
$$
E_{\alpha} = G^{-\frac{1}{2}} \pi_{\alpha} G^{-\frac{1}{2}}
$$ 
are the POVM elements.

Now to find the POVM elements explicitly, consider
\begin{align*}
G^{-1} & = \frac{2}{7}
\begin{bmatrix}
2 & -\frac{e^{-i\frac{\pi}{4}}}{\sqrt{2}} \\ 
-\frac{e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}}}{\sqrt{2}} & 2\\ 
\end{bmatrix}\\
\sqrt{G} & = \frac{1}{\sqrt{4+2\sqrt{\frac{7}{2}}}}
\begin{bmatrix}
2+\sqrt{\frac{7}{2}} & \frac{e^{-i\frac{\pi}{4}}}{\sqrt{2}}\\ 
\frac{e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}}}{\sqrt{2}} & 2+\sqrt{\frac{7}{2}}\\ 
\end{bmatrix}\\
\frac{1}{\sqrt{G}} & = \frac{\sqrt{4+2\sqrt{\frac{7}{2}}}}{7+4\sqrt{\frac{7}{2}}}
\begin{bmatrix}
2+\sqrt{\frac{7}{2}} & -\frac{e^{-i\frac{\pi}{4}}}{\sqrt{2}}\\ 
-\frac{e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}}}{\sqrt{2}} & 2+\sqrt{\frac{7}{2}}\\ 
\end{bmatrix}
\end{align*}

Hence POVM elements are given by
\begin{align*}
E_{1} & = \frac{1}{\sqrt{G}}\pi_{1}\frac{1}{\sqrt{G}} = \frac{4+2\sqrt{\frac{7}{2}}}{(7+4\sqrt{\frac{7}{2})^{2}}}
\begin{bmatrix}
(2+\sqrt{\frac{7}{2}})^{2} & \frac{-(2+\sqrt{\frac{7}{2})}e^{-i\frac{\pi}{4}}}{\sqrt{2}}  \\ 
\frac{-(2+\sqrt{\frac{7}{2})}e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}}}{\sqrt{2}} & \frac{1}{2}\\ 
\end{bmatrix}\\
E_{2} & = \frac{1}{\sqrt{G}}\pi_{2}\frac{1}{\sqrt{G}} = \frac{4+2\sqrt{\frac{7}{2}}}{(7+4\sqrt{\frac{7}{2})^{2}}}
\begin{bmatrix}
\frac{1}{2} & \frac{-(2+\sqrt{\frac{7}{2})}e^{-i\frac{\pi}{4}}}{\sqrt{2}}\\ 
\frac{-(2+\sqrt{\frac{7}{2})}e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}}}{\sqrt{2}} & (2+\sqrt{\frac{7}{2}})^{2}\\ 
\end{bmatrix}\\
E_{3} & = \frac{1}{\sqrt{G}}\pi_{3}\frac{1}{\sqrt{G}} = \frac{4+2\sqrt{\frac{7}{2}}}{(7+4\sqrt{\frac{7}{2})^{2}}}*\frac{1}{2}\\
&\begin{bmatrix}
(2+\sqrt{\frac{7}{2}})^{2}-(2+\sqrt{\frac{7}{2}})+\frac{1}{2} & -\sqrt{2}(2+\sqrt{\frac{7}{2}})e^{\frac{-i\pi}{4}}+(2+\sqrt{\frac{7}{2}})^{2}+\frac{e^{\frac{-i\pi}{2}}}{2} \\
-\sqrt{2}(2+\sqrt{\frac{7}{2}})e^{\frac{i\pi}{4}}+(2+\sqrt{\frac{7}{2}})^{2}+\frac{e^{\frac{i\pi}{2}}}{2} & (2+\sqrt{\frac{7}{2}})^{2}-(2+\sqrt{\frac{7}{2}})+\frac{1}{2}\\
\end{bmatrix}\\
E_{4} & = \frac{1}{\sqrt{G}}\pi_{4}\frac{1}{\sqrt{G}} = \frac{4+2\sqrt{\frac{7}{2}}}{(7+4\sqrt{\frac{7}{2})^{2}}}*\frac{1}{2}\\
&\begin{bmatrix}
(2+\sqrt{\frac{7}{2}})^{2}-(2+\sqrt{\frac{7}{2}})+\frac{1}{2} & -\sqrt{2}(2+\sqrt{\frac{7}{2}})e^{\frac{-i\pi}{4}}-i(2+\sqrt{\frac{7}{2}})^{2}+\frac{ie^{\frac{-i\pi}{2}}}{2} \\ 
-\sqrt{2}(2+\sqrt{\frac{7}{2}})e^{\frac{i\pi}{4}}+i(2+\sqrt{\frac{7}{2}})^{2}-\frac{ie^{\frac{-i\pi}{2}}}{2} & (2+\sqrt{\frac{7}{2}})^{2}-(2+\sqrt{\frac{7}{2}})+\frac{1}{2}\\
\end{bmatrix},
\end{align*}
satisfying $\sum_{\alpha=1}^{4} E_{\alpha}= I$.

\section*{A Tribute to my Guru}

Some things are easier said than done - accepting that Professor G. Ramachandran
(G.R.) is no longer with us, is no different. A mentor to me throughout, I cannot thank
him enough for several reasons; the most important of them being, a sense of realization for me that Physics was what I wanted to do for the rest of my life. I owe this to him.

My association with Professor G.R. began as his student in 1980 - it was my dream
to pursue and learn Physics and hence, I made my way to Mysore in 1979 to make that
dream a reality. Although I was not his student until my final year, he was not new to
any of us - his classes were legendary and I had heard how dynamic his lectures were.
Some of my seniors including Malini Kamath and Usha Sathyanarayana revered him,
which I would soon realise myself - he was no ordinary teacher. I had opted for Theoretical Physics as my specialization and the first five minutes into his class, I was floored.
I knew just then that this was how I wanted to learn Physics and to continue doing this
for a long time to come. All the wonderful things I had heard about his teaching and
classes were pale in comparison to my own experience in his class. His sessions were
magical - they seemed surreal. Too good to be true, they said and I could not agree
more. My passion for the subject grew tremendously and every one of his classes only
intensified that. His classes would transport you to a different world - a world full of
possibilities and adventures. The inspiration I drew from him then, continues to this day.

I realised early on that comprehending all of his teachings would not be an easy task
for me. Therefore, I began noting down everything including all anecdotes and trivia he
shared during his lectures. I realise today, as I go through some of my notes, that these
snippets of information and original references he provided are hard to come by.
During my M. Sc, G.R. taught us an entire paper comprising of many important topics
- according to our schedule, this meant 4 hours per week. However, his classes were so
full of life, learning and information that three days a week, his classes went on from 2
PM until 6 PM! It amazed me then and it amazes me today as a teacher myself, the
sheer amount of topics he covered and how! I remember he started with the concept of
Hilbert space and taught Angular momentum theory extensively. I would like to share
a memory from the time - I attended an interview conducted by CSIR in New Delhi for
my Post Doctoral Fellowship. The committee had some of the best people in the field
including Professor V. Balakrishnan, Professor Rohini Godbole and Professor Avinash
Khare. The minute they realised that I was G.R's Ph.D. student, one of them immediately said - “then we will not be asking you about Angular momentum. You would know
it better than us”. I was astonished and honoured to have been under his guidance and
this was such a defining moment for me. Experts in the field did not fail to acknowledge	
his mastery in the field of Angular momentum and we, his students, were also on the
receiving end of this recognition!


After teaching Angular momentum exhaustively, GR took up Dirac equation and then
moved onto scattering theory. He taught us quantization of Dirac, Klein-Gordon,
Maxwell fields and later, processes like pair creation/annihilation, Compton scattering,
Bhabha scattering among others. After QED, he introduced us to strong interaction -
right from n-p scattering to basics of QCD. He then went on to teach us Fermi's theory of
$\beta$-Decay and Lee-Yang's theory of parity violation, introducing electro-weak unification
of Weinberg and Salaam. He taught us the density matrix formalism and its application which involved his research work with MVN Murthy, RS Keshavamurthy and KS
Mallesh.


My attempt at describing G.R. and his imprint on some of us will be an exercise in
futility, however, I shall try. There are not many like him. His immeasurable patience
and willingness to go out of his way to ensure his students had no ambiguity with his
lessons, cannot be compared. His insistence on making the class interactive by encouraging us to question him and his marathon discussions with the class - all unforgettable.
He would insist on strong discussions in the class and outside- these have instilled in
me the imperative need of having open interactions in my sessions today as well. Here’s
an example G.R. himself shared with us one day - G.R. was having a discussion with a
visitor- a famous Physicist at IISC, Bangalore, when a young student asked the visitor a
question about his work. The great man snubbed the student with an evasive reply and
the said student, dejectedly walked away. G.R., unable to digest this, went in search of
the student and clarified his doubts. I have never known him to turn away a student
for want of his time. He was always there for his students. Always. This trait in him,
to go that extra mile and ensuring that no student ever left without learning something
valuable and clarifying doubts without an ounce of judgement, was what drew many
students to him. He was that professor in the university who was constantly surrounded
by students. If the students came up with frivolous questions, he would gently steer
them towards more profound issues. This would be the beginning of a lifelong love affair
with Physics for all his students. Case in point is yours truly.


I was privileged to have experienced the greatness of G.R. - the teacher and the inimitable researcher. I was able to witness first hand, the thought process of a brilliant
mind. My journey with Physics continues in his absence by following the path he paved
for us so efficiently and effortlessly.

G.R. had a child like curiosity and enthusiasm which was incredibly infectious! Professor K.R. Parthasarathy was invited by the University of Mysore to give a series of
lectures in the Mathematics and Statistics departments. After the lectures, G.R. was
brimming with joy and enthusiasm and told us - “Now I know how to view the spin
density matrix in terms of a statistical distribution!”. That was the beginning of our
sojourn in the field of quasi-probability distributions of spin systems, which eventually
led to my PhD thesis `Theoretical Study of Spin Distributions in external electric and
magnetic fields'. My PhD journey would not have been the fantastic experience that it
was, without him. Those intense and stimulating discussions with Professor G.R. and
Ushadevi are truly unforgettable and later, paved the way for the publication of half a
dozen papers.


An admirable quality of G.R. was his willingness to admit his ignorance in front of
his students. Surely, it takes great humility to have no inhibition in admitting one’s
unawareness. According to G.R, this was a trait that even his guide Professor Alladi
Ramakrishnan possessed. Once, Professor Alladi brought in a research paper which
used natural units ($\hslash = c = 1$) to the classroom openly admitting that he did not quite
understand it. This of course, led his students to work out possible solutions on their
own. G.R. too, adopted this method and I have such fond memories of these exercises!
The fact that he was quite generous with his compliments to the students who solved
the problems, needs to be mentioned.


Everyone is someone's teacher. But not everyone can have the effect G.R. did, on
me and several others too. He was an extraordinarily gifted teacher who had abundant
patience and determination to ensure we understood the most difficult of concepts in
Physics. If we were found wanting, he would not hesitate to begin from the basics and
patiently guide us all the way in order to encourage us to appreciate the physics behind
it. He was our role model in a true sense. Should I stumble upon a complex concept
to explain or teach, it fascinates me to this day that I tend to visualise all the possible
ways Professor G.R.,would have done it.


Most people go through their lives without having a ‘Guru’ - I am proud and honoured to say that I am not one of them. I had a Guru - a bond that I will cherish and
honour, till the end of time. Thank you, Professor G.R.
