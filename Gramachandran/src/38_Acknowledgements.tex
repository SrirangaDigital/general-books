\chapter*{Acknowledgements}

The Editorial Committee wishes to thank all authors for submitting their articles for this commemorative book on Late Prof. G. Ramachandran. We deeply appreciate the intense efforts put in by each author in preparing the articles. We wish to thank all the members of Prof. Ramachandran's family, including his younger brother Mr. G. Viswanathan, for sharing several documents and other details about Prof. Ramachandran which helped us in preparing a biographical sketch of Prof. Ramachandran for the book. We thank Dr. S. P. Shilpashree for sharing the list of publications of Prof. Ramachandran. We are grateful to Prof. C. S. Yogananda and his Team at Sriranga Digital Software Technologies, Mysuru, for accepting our request to compile the articles, design and publish the book. We thank him for accommodating our requests, several times, for replacing a few articles by their revised versions. If the book has come out in such a good shape, it is largely due to the efforts of Prof. Yogananda's Team.
