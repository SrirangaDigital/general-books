Let me thank Professor Ghanashyam Date for inviting me and Professor M V N Murthy
for agreeing to present some of my recollections on my behalf.

I was at the Institute of Mathematical Sciences in the first three years of the
Institute [after its inauguration], during which I was given an opportunity to give
a Course of Lectures on the Quantum Theory of Angular Momentum and to assist
in guiding Dr.\ K Ananthanarayanan and Late Dr.\ R K Umerjee. The work with Dr.\ 
Ananthanarayanan was appreciated by Late Professor L I Schiff, while the work with
Dr.\ Umerjee led me much later to the realization of what Professor Murthy and I
referred to as Non-Oriented Spin Systems and to the beautiful SU(n) representation
[of the density matrix of arbitrary spin systems] proposed by us. The early work
carried out by Professor V Devanathan and myself here [in Madras] on photo-pion
production motivated me to formulate a new method, during the first decade of
this century, to derive the multipole expansions for photo-production and electro-
production of mesons with arbitrary spin-parities at higher energies in collaboration
with Dr.\ M S Vidya and Professor J Balasubramanyam. These new results specialize
exactly to the corresponding CGLN [Chew, Goldberge, Low and Nambu] expansions
in the particularly simple case of pseudo-scalar mesons

The exhortation that research is best done when it is part of a way of life, by
my teacher Late Professor Alladi Ramakrishnan, has all along influenced me. The
frequent meetings with eminent scientists, which were highly inspiring, right from
the time I joined as a student was given an identity when he created the Theoretical
Physics Seminar on Sri Rama Navami in 1959. I was a Member from its inception.
Apart from the tireless work and the emotional attachment to the cause of 
Theoretical physics, we contributed money too, in the form of the Membership fee paid every
month and additional payments for all the dinners and buffet parties without exception. 
The List of Members is attached. I also had the privilege of giving a Course
of Lectures on Nuclear Physics to the first batch of M Sc Nuclear Physics students
comprising Professor A P Balachandran, Professor G Bhamathi, Dr.\ T K Radha and
Dr.\ R Thunga.

Finally I wish to record the advice, ``You have taken a step forward; donâ€™t take it
back", given early at a very difficult time by my father Late Sri Gowravaram Venkata
Krishnaiah (G V K) garu.

It was crucial for my continuation in research, which was given a new life by the
great scientist Dr.\ C R Rao F R S and my dear friend Dr.\ B Ramachandran F N A at
the end of my tenure at MATSCIENCE (I M Sc).

Thank you.
