In
the
half–century
that
followed,
almost
every
premier
European
university
had
started
a
Sanskrit
and
Indology
department.
It
became
important
for
intellectuals
to
learn
this
language,
or
at
least
be
familiar
with
the
contents
of
its
texts.
Western
thought
was
transformed
forever
as
a
result
of
this
encounter…It
is
unfortunate
that
when
the
European
intellectual
movement
known
as
the
Enlightenment
is
taught,
the
Indian
influences
are
ignored
or
else
reduced
to
mere
footnotes.
The
European
Enlightenment
is
made
to
look
like
an
entirely
internal
development
by
Europeans,
without
any
contribution
from
elsewhere.
Nonetheless,
during
the
time
of
that
movement,
there
was
great
enthusiasm
for
appropriating
Sanskrit
ideas,
digesting
them
into
Western
languages
and
frameworks,
and
using
them
in
intellectually
innovative
ways.
The
benefits
of
this
knowledge
were
felt
in
several
modern
fields,
including
philosophy,
botany,
psychology,
linguistics,
anthropology,
ethics,
mathematics,
Christian
theology
and
comparative
religion.

the

These

define

The

establishing
the
\textit

\textit

(not

\textbf
{because
it

What
is
produced
is
known
to
be
\textit
{anitya}
as
in
the
case
of
a
pot.
Here,
the
\textit
{dharma}
of
“being
produced”
is
common
to
both
\textit
{śabda}
and
the
pot.
\textit
{Hetu}
is
also
shown
by
dissimilarity:
\textit
{śabda}
is
\textit
{anitya}
because
it
is
produced.
That
which
is
not
created
or
produced
such
as
\textit

(eternal).
In
this

the
\textit

of

\textit

\textit
{Śabda}
(sound)
is
\textit
{anitya}
(not
eternal)
because
it
is
produced.
Here,
a
pot
is
taken
as
the
\textit
{udāharaṇa}.
The
\textit
{dharma}
of
being
produced
is
in
the
pot
also
and
thus
it
is
not
eternal.
The
\textit
{dharma}
of
“being
produced”
is
there
both
in
\textit
{śabda}
and
the
pot
and
so
they
are
similar.
In
the
example
of
the
pot,
both
the
\textit
{dharma}–s
of
“being
produced”
and
“not
eternal”
are
present.
