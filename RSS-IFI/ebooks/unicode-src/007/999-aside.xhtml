			<p>1 India itself cannot be viewed only as a bundle of the old and the new, accidentally and uncomfortably pieced together, an artificial construct without a natural unity. Nor is she just a repository of quaint, fashionable accessories to Western lifestyles; nor a junior partner in a global capitalist world. India is its own distinct and unified civilization with a proven ability to manage profound differences, engage creatively with various cultures, religions and philosophies, and peacefully integrate many diverse streams of humanity. These values are based on ideas about divinity, the cosmos and humanity that stand in contrast to the fundamental assumptions of Western civilization.</p>

			<p>2 <strong>World Systems Analysis</strong> (Wallerstein 2004): </p>
			<p>World Systems analysis is a methodology a few decades old, pioneered by Immanuel Wallerstein, and taken up and developed by many mainstream scholars. This is an attempt to systematically, and falsifiably (hence scientifically), set up a framework to analyze social events in a unidisciplinary way. The reason why it makes an appealing contrast to patently unscientific hypotheses like Axiality is that these have a built in history of Western Universalistic axioms that are not possibly to explicitly falsify(being based on authoritativeness, but can be seen increasingly to be less and less applicable to societies that do not share the peculiarities of Western European history.</p>
			<p>Being unidisciplinary is to eschew the historical problems, involving the way disciplines in current social science have evolved from a Eurocentric base. It puts categories of time and space in a frame with a beginning and end, i.e. understandable limits. Time is based on the ‘<em>longue duree</em>’, lasting from the beginning to the end of the particular ‘world system’. The geographical space is the space which functions as a ‘world’ with its own multiple nation-states with their own production processes and interstate trade and other interactions, e.g. the Mediterranean world.</p>
			<p>Wallerstein and others have established that the European world since the industrial revolution can be seen as a prototypical world-system, a system that, moreover, has over the centuries expanded to encompass most of the globe today, and a system that is in its end stages now.</p>
			<p>While this system needs much more development and broadening to be really applicable to our topic at hand, i.e. ancient Indian history, its value lies in the fact that we can see it as a clear mirror that can show up the problems and plain incapability of the current systems of social science to show a satisfactory model of ancient India. Needless to say, one key category that India and other non-Western civilizations can add to the world systems is the <em>ādhyātmika</em> aspect; since the current European Enlightenment based systems – even world-systems – only have an ill-suited and narrowly relevant category of “Religion” to cover a vast aspect of human personal and social life.</p>

			<p>7 \endnote{ “The Tathāgata sometimes taught that the <em>ātman</em>} exists and at other times he taught that the <em>ātman</em> does not exist. When he preached that the <em>ātman</em> exists and is to be the receiver of misery or happiness in the successive life as the reward of its own Karma,} his object was to save men from falling into the heresy of Nihilism (<em>Uccheda-vāda</em>). When he taught that there is no <em>ātman</em> in the sense of a creator or perceiver or an absolutely free agent, apart from the conventional name given to the aggregate of the five <em>skandhas</em>, his object was to save men from falling into the opposite, heresy of Eternalism (<em>Śāśvata-vāda</em>). Now which of these two views represents the truth? It is doubtless the doctrine of the denial of <em>ātman</em>. This doctrine, which is so difficult to understand, was not intended by Buddha for the ears of those whose intellect is dull and in whom the root of goodness has not thriven. And why? Because such men by hearing the doctrine of <em>anātman</em>} would have been sure to fall into the heresy of Nihilism. The two doctrines were preached by Buddha for two very different objects. He taught the existence of <em>ātman</em> when he wanted to impart to his hearers the conventional doctrine; he taught the doctrine of <em>anātman</em> when he wanted to impart to them the transcendental doctrine.”</p>

It must, however, be admitted that while the Upaniṣadic seers openly identify the Absolute with the Pure Self which is at once pure consciousness and bliss, Buddha, true to his negative logic, does not expressly identify the Absolute with the Pure Self, though the implication is clearly there. He identifies the Absolute with <em>Nirvāṇa</em>. Buddha’s omission to identify the Absolute with the Transcendent Self has led to the misunderstanding of his <em>anātmavāda</em>.

It is frankly admitted by Professor Rhys Davids that,</p>
<p>‘The neuter Brahman} is, so far as I am aware, entirely unknown in the Nikāyas, and of course the Buddha's idea of Brahmā, in the masculine, really differs widely from that of the Upanishads.’</p>

The attack which they led upon the idea of soul or self is directed against the conception of the eternity in time of an unchanging individuality; of the timeless spirit they do not speak, and yet they claim to have disposed of the theory of the Ātman! In reality both sides were in agreement that the soul or ego (manas, ahamkāra, vijñāna,} etc.) is complex and phenomenal, while of that which is ‘not so’ we know nothing.”</p>
