Pollock\index
{Pollock,

is
aware
of
the
contentious
nature
of
his
prescribed
dates.
He
pre-emptively
states:
‘even
the
dates
I
have
given
for
framing
the
limits
of
its
(Pollock

origin
and
dissolution
may
be
disputed’
and
then
pushes
forward
without
providing
any
discussion
on,
or
resolution
of,
this
dispute.

macro:->Here
are
some
additional
notes
about
Baldev
Upadhyaya\index
{Upadhyaya,
Baldev}
worth
mentioning.
O’Hanlon\index
{O’Hanlon,
Rosalind}
(2010)
has
referred
to
Upadhyaya’s
work
and
so
has
Aklujkar\index
{Aklujkar,
Ashok}
in
his
articles
which
appear
in
\textit
{The
Paṇḍit}.
Aklujkar
considers
Upadhyaya’s
work
as
the
best
source
to
know
about
the
Kashi
Paṇḍits.
He
also
acknowledges
Sinha’s
work
on
Bengal
Paṇḍits
as
the
best
work
to
refer
to
for
Paṇḍits
of
Bengal.
As
a
matter
for
research,
it
would
be
meaningful
to
compare
and
contrast
the
life-style
of
the
Paṇḍits
from
two
different
parts
of
India,
contemporaneous
or
not.
