\chapter*{Preface}

For more than ten years, Gauri, wife of RP Malik of Banares Hindu University has been persuading me to write my autobiography. Finally I succumbed.

The biography of S Chandrasekhar, the famous astrophysicist, was
written by Kameshwar Wali. Chandrasekar himself wrote his scientific
autobiography, but did not publish it. Wali published it after Chandra
passed away. I got the inspiration for writing my scientific autobiography
from this.

So this book has two parts: Part I My Inward Bould Journey and Part II:
My Scientific Autobiography. There is some overlap between these two
parts.

M V N Murthy has been kind enough to put the whole thing together in the 
form of a book.

I thank N Mukunda for the excellent Foreword that he has written for 
the book.
