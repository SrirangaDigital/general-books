\subsection*{Summary}

\section*{I. Prāṇāyāma-s (Kumbhakas) in Haṭhayogapradī\-pikā}

Sūryabhedanam, ujjāyī, sītkārī, śītalī, bhastrikā, bhrāmarī, mūrcchā and plāvinī are the eight Prāṇāyāmas/Kumbhakas. 2.44

\heading{Prāṇāyāma -- 1: Sūryabhedanam}

A practitioner of Yoga should be seated in a comoftable seat. After assuming an āsana (posture) the air from outside has to be inhaled through the right nostril.  Then having the hair on the head and the tip of the nails of the fingers of the feet as the limit (as the air held within is felt all over the body mentioned in this manner) the breath should be held. Then slowly the through the left nostril the air has to be exhaled.  2.48,49

\heading{Benefits of sūryabhedanam}

This best practice cleanses the skull region, removes diseases caused by vititation of Vāta and worms (in the abdomen). Hence this has to be done again and again. 2.50

\heading{Prāṇāyāma -- 2: Ujjāyī}

With closed mouth the air has to be drawn slowly through the nostrils till the sound is felt from throat to the chest/heart. One has to hold the breath as stated earlier (in Sūryabhedana) and exhale through the Iḍā nāḍī / left nostril. 2.51

\heading{Benefits of Ujjāyī}

This prāṇāyāma called Ujjāyī stimulates (digestive) fire in the body, removes diseases caused by Kapha, and removes problmes related to Nāḍīs, water (infection), stomach and stomach. This can be done by a person who is standing or walking.  2.52,53

\heading{Prāṇāyāma -- 3: Sītkārī}

Inhalation should be done throught he mouth while making the sound ‘sīt’ and exhalation should be done through the nostril(s) only. 2.54-1

\heading{Benefits of sītkārī}

By practicing in this manner, one shall become Kāmadeva (the god of love – handsome). He will be respected by all the Yoginis and becomes the creator and annihilator. There will be no hunger, thirst, sleep or laziness. By this practice, the body also becomes strong and a person will beomce king among the practitioners on the earth and will be free from any sufferings.   2.54.2-56

\heading{Prāṇāyāma -- 4:  Śītalī}

An intelligent person should inhale the air (slowly) through the tongue and hold the breath as earlier (as in Sūryabhedana). Then, the air has to be exhaled through both the nostrils slowly.  2.57

\heading{Benefits of śītalī}

This Śītalī, which is a well known practice of Prāṇāyāma, completely removes gulma\footnote{Gulma refers to abdominal pain due to various causes including formation of mass of cells, enlargement of abdominal glands. Pliha refers to the enlargement of spleen.}, pliha (and such other diseases), hunger, thirst and poisons.  2.58

\heading{Prāṇāyāma -- 5: Bhastrikā}

One should stay seated placing the upward facing soles of feet on the (opposite) thighs. This is Padmāsana that removes all Sins(59). Aligning the neck and the adomen (in a straight line) a steady-minded person having firmly assumed Padmāsana, should exhale Prāṇa with sound through one nostril (the right nostril) with effort, sealing the mouth firmly(60). The breath being exhaled should be felt from the chest-throat region till the skull region. Then, the breath has to be inhaled quickly (through one/right nostril) (61). In this manner repeatedly exhalation and inhalation has to be done. Just like the bellows of the backsmith which is operated rapidly (62) the breath in the body has to be operated mindfully. When tiredness is experienced in the body, then inhale through the right nostril(63). One should inhale in the manner by which the abdomen is filled with air quickly. One should (then) hold the nose with the fingers excluding the middle and index fingers(64). After holding the breath as per injunctions (stated while explaining Sūryabhedana) one should exhale through the left nostril. 2.58-65.1

\heading{Benefits of Bhastrikā}

This (Bhastrikā) removes (imbalances) Vata, Pitta and Kapaha. It enhances the bodily (digestive) fire. It also destroys the obstructions like Kapha that lie in the mouth of the Suṣumnā Nāḍī. Bhastrikā also pierces the three granthis (knots) that are firmly entrenched in the body. (Hence) this practice called Bhastrikā, has to be done especially. 2.65-2 - 67

\heading{Prāṇāyāma -- 6: Bhrāmarī}

Inhalation has to be done rapidly with sound that resembles the sound of a male bee. Exhalation has to be done slowly, slowly with the sound resembling the sound of a female bee. 2.68-1

\heading{Benefits of Bhrāmarī}

By being involved in the practice in this manner, an inexplicable bliss manifests in the mind of the best among the Yogins.

\heading{Other Practices -- Nāḍīśodhana and its Benefits}

A Yogi seated in the Padmāsana should inhale through the left nostril. After holding the breath to the level of one’s capability one should exhale through the right nostril(7). (Then) The abdomen has to be filled slowly with air by inhaling through the right nostril and after holding the breath as per injunctions (with Bandhas) one should exhale through the left nostril (8). One has to inhale through that nostril by which exhalation has been done. Then one should hold the breath with great intensity and exhale the breath slowly and not quickly, through the other nostril (9).  If the breath is inhaled through the left nostril then after holding the breath, exahaltion has to be done thorugh the other nostril. Then through the right nostril the breath has to be inhaled. After holding the breath it has to be exhaled through the left nostril. This activity of the Sun and moon (the left and right-nostrils) done by the self-restrained practitioners will result in the cleansing of the Nāḍīs after three months. 

\heading{Kapālabhāti and its Benefits}

Like the bellows of the Blacksmith - exhaling and inhaling rapidly is the well known kapāla-bhāti. It dries out the vitiation of Kapha. 2.35

\begin{enumerate}
\itemsep=0pt
\item The seat for prāṇāyāma can constitue cloth, dry Darbha grass mat etc
\item Svastikāsana, Virāsana or padmāsana is preferable. Or Siddhāsana is the best for Prāṇāyāma. 
\item Right nāḍī refers to Piṅgala and the left nāḍī refers to Iḍā. 
\item Holding the breath should be so intense that Prāṇa is felt all over the body. 
\item Though it has been stated that Kumbhka has to done with intense effort, the intensity here refers to the intensity of intention – to succed in Prāṇāyāma and it does not refer to forcing the breath. Holding the breath has to be done gradually. The capability has to be built gradually – like taming an elephant or a lion. 
\item Exahalation has to be done only slowly. If one exhales quickly it - may result in loss of strength (Bala-hani). To emphasize this, the word śanaiḥ is repated twice.

One should stay seated placing the upward facing soles of feet on the (opposite) thighs. This is Padmāsana that removes all Sins(59). Aligning the neck and the adomen (in a straight line) a steady-minded person having firmly assumed Padmāsana, should exhale Prāṇa with sound through one nostril (the right nostril) with effort, sealing the mouth firmly(60). The breath being exhaled should be felt from the chest-throat region till the skull region. Then, the breath has to be inhaled quickly (through one/right nostril) (61). In this manner repeatedly exhalation and inhalation has to be done. Just like the bellows of the backsmith which is operated rapidly (62) the breath in the body has to be operated mindfully. When tiredness is experienced in the body, then inhale through the right nostril(63). One should inhale in the manner by which the abdomen is filled with air quickly. One should (then) hold the nose with the fingers excluding the middle and index fingers(64). After holding the breath as per injunctions (stated while explaining Sūryabhedana) one should exhale through the left nostril.

\subsection*{Inputs from Jyotsnā Commentary}


\begin{enumerate}
\item The method of practice of Bhastrikā is like this -

The left nostril has to be blocked by the little and ring fingers of right hand and the rapid inhalation and exhalation has to be done by the right nostril. When one gets tired then inhalation has to be done by the same right nostril and Kumbhaka has to be practiced (with the Bandhas). Then exhalation has to be done through the left nostril. After that, the right nostril has to be blocked with the thumb and rapid inhalation and exhalation like the bellows has to be done through the left nostril. Then when one tires, inhalation has to be done through the left nostril and it has to be closed with the ring and the little fingers (of the right hand). After holding the breath according one’s capacity, exahaltion has to be done through the right nostril. This is one method of practicing Bhastrikā. 
\item Second method - The left nostril has to be blocked with the ring and little fingers (of the right hand). Quick Inhalation has to be done through the right nostril and immediately blocking it with the thumb, exahaltion has to be done through the left nostril.  This has to be done for hundred times. When one feels tired, inhalation has to be done through right nostril. After holding the breath along with the Bandhas, exahalation has to be done through the left nostril. Again, the right nostril has to be blocked with the thumb and inhalation has to be done through the left nostril. Immediately closing the left nostril with the ring and little fingers – exhalation has to be done through the right nostril like the bellows. After having done this inhalation and exhalation again and again (for hundered times), when one tires, inhalation has to be done through the left nostril. Then it has to be closed with the ring and little fingers. Kumbhaka has to be practiced and exhalation has to be done through the right nostril. This is the second method.

This (Bhastrikā) removes (imbalances) Vata, Pitta and Kapaha. It enhances the bodily (digestive) fire. It also destroys the obstructions like Kapha that lie in the mouth of the Suṣumnā Nāḍī. Bhastrikā also pierces the three granthis (knots) that are firmly entrenched in the body. (Hence) this practice called Bhastrikā, has to be done especially.

\subsection*{Inputs from Jyotsnā Commentary}


\begin{enumerate}
\item Bhastrikā is “hita” – benefical to all at all times- because it removes the imbalances in all the three doṣas. 
\item Though all the Prāṇāyāmas are benefical at all times, still – Sūryabhedana and Ujjāyī are hot. Hence they are beneifical in cold season. Sitkari and Sitali are cool and hence they are benefical in hot seasons.  But there is a balance in the hot and cold experiences through Bhastrikā prāṇāyāma and hence it is beneficial always. 
\item Though all the Prāṇāyāmas can address all ailments, still, Sūryabhedana (especially) removes imbalances in Vata. Ujjāyī mostly removes Kapha. Sitkari and Sitali remove imbalances in Pitta. It should be understood that Bhastrikā prāṇāyāma balances all the three doṣas.  
\item In the Suṣumnā there are three Granthis – knots – called Brahmagranthi, Viṣṇugranthi and Rudragranthi.  All the three are pierced by this practice. 
\item Hence, this prāṇāyāma has to be certainly done. While Sūryabhedana and others can be done based on requirement.

\subsection*{Note on Mūrcchā and Plāvinī   (Prāṇāyāmas – 7\&8 in the series of Eight Kumbhakas)}


Thus far six Kumbhakas/prāṇāyāmas out of eight as part of the aṣṭakumbhakas were elaborated. The last two Mūrcchā  and Plāvinī are not elaborated as they are not practiced in the Krishnnamacharya Tradition. Basically, the two Prāṇāyāmas are centred on attaining extraordinary capabilities.  The gist of the two practices is as follows – The practice of Mūrcchā  grants a state of unconsciousness that is blissfull. It is practiced by inhaling (whether through nostrils or by mouth is not specified –even in the commentary) and doing very firm Jālandhara bandha amd exhalaing very slowly.  Plāvinī grants the capability to float on the surface of even very deep waters. The practice is done by inhaling excessively and filling  the abdomen (no further descrptions are found either in the text or the commentary).

A Yogi seated in the Padmāsana should inhale through the left nostril. After holding the breath to the level of one’s capability one should exhale through the right nostril(7). (Then) The abdomen has to be filled slowly with air by inhaling through the right nostril and after holding the breath as per injunctions (with Bandhas) one should exhale through the left nostril (8). One has to inhale through that nostril by which exhalation has been done. Then one should hold the breath with great intensity and exhale the breath slowly and not quickly, through the other nostril (9).  If the breath is inhaled through the left nostril then after holding the breath, exahaltion has to be done thorugh the other nostril. Then through the right nostril the breath has to be inhaled. After holding the breath it has to be exhaled through the left nostril. This activity of the Sun and moon (the left and right-nostrils) done by the self-restrained practitioners will result in the cleansing of the Nāḍīs after three months. 

\subsection*{Inputs from the Jyotsnā Commentary}


\begin{enumerate}
\item In the context of verse 7 - Jyotsnā commentary defines Pūraka, recaka and Kumbhaka as follows – Pūraka – The intake of the air from outside with special (mindful/slow) effort  is Pūraka/inhalation. Kumbhaka – Holding of the breath with Bandhas like Jālandhara is Kumbhaka. Recaka – This is expelling of the breath that was held with special (mindful/long) effort. The rapid inhalation and exhalation which has been described as part of Kapālabhāti cannot be termed as Pūraka and Recaka as they do not confirm to the definition given above. 
\item Vidhivat (as per injunctions)– this term appears in the verse 8 – to describe kumbhaka. It indicates the practice of the Bandhas during holding the breath. 
\item Atirodhataha (with great intensity) – this term appears in the verse 9 to describe Kumbhaka. Holding the breath till one experiences sweat, trembling is to be understood as the great intensity (atiroadhatah) during holding the breath.
\item Though verses 7-9 have described the process of Nāḍīshodhan –verse 10 serves the purpose of summarizing the content of three verses (7-9) in one verse and it also mentions benefits of Nāḍīśodhana. (“the Nāḍīs of the self-restrained practitioners will be cleansed after three months”).
